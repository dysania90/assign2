Research
Presently, I am working on a Master's thesis entitled An Environment
to Reconstruct Surfaces from Contour Data under the guidance of
Professor Kenneth Sloan and Professor John Johnstone. The software I
am developing is meant to be extremely portable and extensible. I
hope to be able to extend it to work with other data situations, mainly
scattered data and multiple orthogonal contours. When I get the
wherewithall, I will place the proposal online.




Here is my first real Java program. 
I did this for my Computer Graphics II project. (Hint: This version has
an error. Can you find it?)


Personal
When I'm not transfixed to a computer or research article, I spend time
reading, role-playing, playing the guitar, and hanging out with my wife, 
Lori, and
our beautiful daughter, Hannah. We are expecting another child in
August.




Here are some useful bookmarks. Send me some
email if you have a site I might be interested in.




Here are some inane attempts at self-categorization.

the 
The Keirsey Temperament Sorter (my wife says that this is right
on the money - I scored at the extreme ends of the I, N, T, and J scales).
