I'm an a.b.d. graduate student at the University of Washington. 


Research




My primary research interest is network routing both in multicomputer
and distributed networks.
My advisor is 
Larry Snyder.
Here's a picture of  Larry
hard at work.




Chaos 
         Chaos routing project -- the Chaos router is a deadlock-free, 
             probabilistically livelock-free, non-minimal, 
             fully adaptive router.

Triplex routing
         The first non-minimal fully adaptive wormhole algorithm for tori
             that uses deadlock-prevention to achieve deadlock-freedom

Simulation
         Simulation of new and existing routing algorithms to learn
             the strengths and weaknesses of various classes
             of routing algorithms; e.g. non-minimal versus minimal
             routing algorithms.

Routing methods and models
         Development of new routing models to help predict
             and compare the performance of new routers 
             in real parallel machines.

Deflection routing
         Upper and lower bounds for practical (e.g. does not require
	     sorting) deflection routing
             algorithms on the 2D mesh topology.
