Let me introduce myself...






I come from  
 Brazil
and this is my first time abroad. I am taking my
Ph.D. in Computer Science at UCI. I work in the 

Computer Systems Design area 
and my interests are in Computer
Architectures and Compilers. I am defining my research topic and I
am working with  
Professor Alex
Nicolau
and 
Professor Michael Franz 
on Compiler Intermediate Representations for portable
code. 




I haven't realized how much I would miss my country, my city and my 
friends! 
Hey guys, do you miss me? I will reserve some space to keep
you informed about  what I am studying here, the places I have been
visiting and my impressions about the USA. I will include some
photos (of course I will skip the photos from my first ski class- a real
disaster!). By the way, if you want to see how I look like take the risk
and load my 

gorgeous picture and more...





Have fun with my 
Java Applet!





Important Conferences and Journals 





Interesting Links
