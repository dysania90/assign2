My Page 

Yes, I know, I should work on this page...



 blink !! 







 Blablabla...
Ok... let me tell you about me.



I'm a Graduate Student at 
Rutgers, in the Department of
Computer Science.



If you want to know if I'm connected right now, you can
finger me on my favorite machines.




I am one of the organisers of the International Contest on
Evolutionnary Optimisation (ICEO), part of the IEEE-ICEC conference.
Check out the pages of the 

First ICEO (may 1996) and the rules for the

Second ICEO (mirror in the
US),
to be held at 
IEEE-ICEC 97 .



And if you like movies, you should check
"Les Extraordinaires
S ances de projection de Philippe Hennebert" (in french -
sorry). The pages are a little bit out of date now, but Philippe has
been very busy lately :-).



Wanna try a little puzzle, and help me to
find the solution? Thanks to

Stefan Schmieta's programming skills, the number to beat is now
66! (Oct 15, 1996)



We are trying to set up a study group to analize the comportment of the
elevators of Hill Center. Our goal is to reverse-engineer those
machines, and try to understand why they behave so strangely. Any
participation is welcome.



CS111 Stuff



I am TA for CS111: Introduction to Computer Science. All students
should visit regularly the
Homepage and
the newsgroup (
ru.nb.dcs.class.111) for this class.
