 Introduction 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at  UT-Austin  in the
 Department of Computer
Sciences.
My supervising professor is  Jayadev Misra  and my
dissertation topic is 
 
 Real-Time UNITY. 
I am a member of Professor Misra's 
 PSP research group. 



I am extending the 
 UNITY 
theory in order to express finite time bounds
on the usual UNITY operators for progress and safety.  I am also
interested in functional programming languages, partial order
semantics and automated theorem proving.
