About me...


I am a fifth year PhD student in the CSE department at UCSD.
I work in Heterogeneous Computing with Prof. Fran Berman.
My thesis work involves modeling the effects of contention
for resources on the behavior of applications.
I plan on graduating by December 96 and going back to life...







Research Interests



Parallel and Heterogeneous Computing
Scheduling in Heterogeneous Platforms
Effects of Contention for Resources
