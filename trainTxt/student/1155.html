Hi

 
Welcome to my home page. I am currently constructing this page and 
will add more contents as time permits. For now I apologize for 
any incompleteness and resulting inconvenience.







Who am I


I am currently a graduate student in the 
Department of Computer Sciences  at the
University of 
Texas at Austin.  




 
Research


I am a member of Professor Mok's 

Real-Time System Research Group.  

My research interests include real-time
scheduling algorithms, operating systems, network performance 
and distributed systems. I also did some work in data replications and 
knowledge mining during my last two summers' internship in 
 GTE Lab and 
MCC.
