Hello to all the curious browsers.  Welcome.  



I am a fourth year graduate student at the UW CS department. I enjoy
theory the most, but I also like to keep in touch with other areas
including AI and graphics.  More on my life and work: academics.  


  
 


 You may want to look at  Islamic
Architecture in Isfahan (a 1995 GNN Best of the Net nominee),
one of the cities in my home country of  Iran.




See ya!
