I moved from Johns Hopkins University to the Imaging &amp; Visualization 
department at  Siemens  Corporate Research, Princeton,
New Jersey in November 95. Contact information. 

 

A PostScript version of my (outdated) resume is here.


 


 Research 
I am interested in solving real-world 
classification  and  prediction  problems
using  machine learning  and other data analysis 
techniques. My current domain of interest is 
medical image analysis . I am very interested in  knowledge
discovery  from data repositories. 
 





  Ph.D. Thesis  

I spent a lot of time putting up my Ph.D. thesis online. As a guest at this
site, it is your moral obligation to check it out! There is a 
 HTML version  that allows 
selective retrieval of just about any portion you want. You may
also retrieve the  compressed PostScript files 
 for individual chapters or the whole thesis.

 Alma Maters 

Before coming to  Department of 
Computer Science  at  Johns Hopkins 
University , I was at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, 
 Indian Institute of
Technology  (1988-1990) and at Department of Computer Science, 
 M. N. Regional Engineering
College  (1984-1988).

 

 

 
 Free Software 
 Steven Salzberg, 
 Simon Kasif  and I distribute
the  OC1  decision tree software system. OC1 
is free for any  non-commercial  use.
