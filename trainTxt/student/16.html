I am a third year computer science major / astronomy minor at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, Ohio. I work part-time in the School of
Medicine as computing assistant to the Office of Medical Education.
I have been in Cleveland for two years now, and I think it's an excellent place to live... 
I drive a charcoal grey 1987 Mercury Sable GS
Wagon now, take a look. I used to drive a dark blue '83
New Yorker 5th Avenue. In high school I drove an Ochre
'72 GMC 1500 pickup. 









I was Born and raised in Racine, Wisconsin (PICTURE)
- a real cool city on Lake Michigan of 83,000+ people. Racine is about
twenty-five miles south of Milwaukee, and is home to the S.C. Johnson Wax Corporation.
Our house is in Wind Point, on the north side of town, just a block or so from the lake.
We always referred to it as the "Beacon Lane Hilton," especially when returning from a
vacation. That's really a joke, because it is not Hilton sized at all. My parents are working
on it, though - after 10 years in that house they finally decided to build an addition off
the back. It will be a great room with a vaulted ceiling, wooden rafters, and a fireplace. 
The old roof needed shingles before the addition could be started - I got to rip off quite
a few old shingles and nail down some new ones during Fouth of July vacation. They are
hoping to have it finished by Thanksgiving -- I sure hope it is. 



My parents, Dan and
Jayne, are the best parents in the world. My brother
Jeff and I had some misunderstandings while we were growing up, but now
we get along a little better. Jeff is going to school out in Maine at Kents
Hill School, where he is a young hockey star. My family has a small beagle
named Caesar - who is a female. She's a cool little pup, but has a problem
with her tongue. She likes to have it hang out about a half an inch
all the time. Its a funny sight, I'll get a picture of it sometime and put it here.
