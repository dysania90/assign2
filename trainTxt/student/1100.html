Experience


I ever worked in Chinese Knowledge Information Processing Group, Institute
of Information Science, Academia Sinica as a research assistant. My major work
is to design a system capable of word segmentation and category tagging using
Hidden Markov Model, and to improve a user-friendly tool allowing user to
execute on-line proof-reading of the result of automatic tagging. The automatic
tagging system now can reach an accuracy of 96%, which can be further improved
because of the continuous expansion of training data.
