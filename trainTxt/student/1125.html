Research

Control knowledge improves the performance of a problem solver by
guiding it to more efficient and accurate solutions. My research
involves using a combination of analytical and inductive machine
learning techniques to acquire this control information.  I am
particularly interested in using such methods to improve the
performance of planning and scheduling systems. For more information,
I have included a detailed  description of my
research, my  vita, and a  list of publications. Also, check out the 
Machine Learning Research Group page.
