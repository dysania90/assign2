 Andy's Home Page 
 Welcome to my home page!

Thank you for stopping by in your cruise of the ever-slowing "Information Superhighway".





As you can probably tell, this is just the first pass in my attempts to build
a homepage worthy of your time. I know I'm not there yet, but, as free time
permits &lt; yeah right laugh &gt;, I'll be exploring the intricacies of HTML.



 So, who am I? 

Well, I just started my second year as a Ph.D. student in the  
Computer Science Department at 
The Johns Hopkins University.  I'm working
under Dr. Russel Taylor, in 
Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery.



This summer, I co-taught a data-structures with my roommate 
Scott Weiss and
some other random guy, 
Stephen Kobourov. 





I graduated from Rice University in 1995,
with a degree in
 Computer Science and
 Cognitive Sciences.


During my stay at Rice, I was a proud member of 
Jones College 
and a two time inhabitant of 
Third South.
I also played in the MOB.



I grew up in Fort Worth,
Texas, where I graduated from HSEP (which
now has an entry

on alumni.net).



There's not much else to say, so thanks for stopping by, and good surfing!
