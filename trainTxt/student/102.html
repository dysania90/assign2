    About me: 

I am a third year graduate student in the  Computation and Neural
Systems option at Caltech.
I'm in the Hopfield
Group.  (As have been many other people.) 
(Directions to my office.)

                 Links 

Other CNS Home Pages of interest include the
 Computer Graphics Lab, 
 Carverland, and the
 Koch Lab.  The
 UGCS WWW Home Page
also has lots of neat stuff.




Fall term '96 I'm TAing Hopfield's class, 

CNS 185: Collective Computation.  I'm taking Yaser's new class,

CNS 156: Learning Systems. 



I've collected some favorite links.

                  Research

My current project concerns DNA-based computers.  



There's not much to say about my robotics 
research.
                  Other Stuff

With  Kurt
Fleischer and other folk in the  Computer Graphics Lab I made a
single-image random dot stereogram (SIRDS) animation, which was shown
at Siggraph 94.  I collected a few frames
together.  Some of this stuff went in a book by Chris Watkins of
 Algorithm Inc.
