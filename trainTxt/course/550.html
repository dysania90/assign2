Description


This course is about operating systems.  Roughly speaking, the
operating system provides a well-known, convenient, and efficient
interface between user programs and the bare hardware of the computer
on which they run.  The operating system is responsible for allowing
resources (e.g., disks, networks, and processors) to be shared,
providing common services needed by many different programs (e.g.,
file service, the ability to start or stop processes, and access to
the printer), and protecting individual programs from one another.
The course will start with a brief historical perspective of the
evolution of operating systems over the last fifty years, and then
cover the major components of most operating systems.  This discussion
will cover the tradeoffs that can be made between performance and
functionality during the design and implementation of an operating
system.  Particular emphasis will be given to three major OS
subsystems: process management, memory management, and the file
system, and operating system support for distributed systems.


Requirements and Grading

 6 Homeworks (15\%)

 3 Programming Projects (45\%)

 3 Exams (40\%) - in-class, open book, and open notes

 Exam 1: first 1/3 of course
 Exam 2: second 1/3 of course
 Final Exam: 75% on final 1/3 of course and 25% over first 2/3s
of course



The course will be graded on a curve.  You are expected to attend
class regularly, read the assigned reading before class, and
participate in class discussions.



 Late Policies  


This course covers a lot of material.  To make it easier to learn, I
have divided the course into many small components.  This division
means late assignments will seriously impact your ability to learn the
next section of the course.  Therefore, I have the following strict
late policies.


  Homework  - no late homeworks will be accepted.  Since several
homeworks are due right before an exam, the solutions will be
published on the day the homework is due and therefore, no late
assignments will be accepted.  I give homeworks to enable you to apply
what you are learning in class before an exam.  They are not a large
portion of your grade, but doing homework will improve your
performance on exams (a much larger portion of your grade), and it is
therefore to your benefit to do all the homeworks and turn them in on
the deadline.  Again, regardless of the circumstances, you will not
get any credit for late homework assignments.


  Labs  - If you turn in your lab late, you will receive a 10\%
penalty for each day after ({\em or portion thereof}\/) that the
assignment was due, up to three days.  Individual extensions without
penalty will be granted only in extreme circumstances (serious illness
with a doctor's note, ...).  It is unfair to the rest of the class if
I give certain individuals extensions, so plan accordingly and start
on your assignments early.


  Exams  - If you will miss an exam or a significant amount
of class time, you  must  tell me ahead of time.  Make up exams
will be oral, and, based on previous experience, will be tougher than
the original exam.



Cooperation and Cheating

Feel free to discuss homework and labs with other members of the
class, myself or the TA.  However, do not look at or copy another
students solution to a homework or lab.  I am not concerned with
how you come to understand the problem and how to solve it, but once
you have the background necessary to solve it, you must provide your
own solution.  Exchanging homework or lab solutions is cheating and
will be dealt with according to University policies.

I used course materials from Tom Anderson, John Carter, Hank Levy, and
Thomas Narten to prepare the lecture notes, homeworks, labs, and
exams. Thanks!
