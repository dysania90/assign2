Instructor
Dr. Anupam Joshi


Syllabus
The CS352 syllabus will be availabe here shortly. The class lectures are available too.


Text

 


Operating Systems Concepts, 4'th Edition, by 
Silberschatz &amp; Galvin, Addison Wesley.

Projects
We are likely to have a couple of small programming assignments, and one reasonable sized project, potentially as a group. It is NOT MANDATORY to
do these in any one language, most modern imperative languages ( such as
C/C++, Pascal, Java, ...) will do fine. However, please do not expect
the instructor or the grader to be proficient in any language that you may
chose to use.
