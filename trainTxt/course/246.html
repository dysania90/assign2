Course Description:

Designed for students who program proficiently in Pascal, BASIC,
Fortran, or some other high-level programming language.  Begins with
an intensive introduction to the C programming language and then
covers all the material in CS 112.



Work Load:

Heavy, fast. This is an intensive course that covers
the topics of CS 111 and CS 112 in one semester.




 Required Textbooks:

The Art and Science of C by Eric Roberts

Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software Principles in C,
by Thomas Standish.





 Optional Reference Texts:

Since neither of the required texts aims to be a comprehensive reference
on the C programming language, you may wish to consider one of the following
reference books.  The first is a classic reference but is quite terse.  The
second is similar in scope, but includes more prose.  The third one is a 
smaller book which has quick reference on most of the important C constructs 
and on the standard library functions; it is less comprehensive.



The C Programming Language, by Kernighan and Ritchie, Prentice
Hall.

C: A Reference Manual, by Harbison and Steele, Prentice Hall.

C: The Pocket Reference, by Herbert Schildt, McGraw-Hill.






Lectures:

	Tue, Thu: 9:30-11:00 am in CAS-204




Sections:

	A2: Tuesdays, 5:00-6:00 pm in MCS-B23 

	A3: Wednesdays, 9:00-10:00 am in MCS-B31




Lab section meetings convene in the CS computer lab (MCS-B24), and
discussion section meetings convene in the rooms listed above.


For a schedule of which section meetings will be labs and which will
be discussions, please see the
Course Schedule.  I will also
make announcements regarding section meetings in lecture on Tuesdays.

Programming exercises will be completed during lab section that will
contribute towards your final grade. 





Grading: 
 Grading will be based on the following approximate weighting: 



  55% Programming assignments and labs 

  15% Mid-term  
  
  30% Final (comprehensive) 



If there are questions about grades, please see the TA.



There will be no incompletes in this course.
