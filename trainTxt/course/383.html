For the Fall of 1996, CS 5, "Structured Programming and Problem Solving", is being
taugh in an experimental format relying on web-based notes, recitation/Q&amp;A sessions,
and hands-on lab sessions. 



The material has been divided up along the lines of calendar weeks.
A "week" consists of:

A set of lecture notes, to be studied
in advance (presumably over the weekend) of the recitation/Q&amp;A session on Monday



A set of lab problems to reinforce the ideas in the that week's notes, 
to be done in lab on Tuesday or Wednesday (depending on your assigned lab section)



A homework assignment to reinforce and test
the ideas in the lecture, to be worked on that week and due the following Tuesday.

Note that the homework for a given week overlaps into the next week. 
This allows you to use a second recitation to ask any lingering
questions before the assignment is due.



The following list gives you direct access to the lecture notes,
lab problems, and homework problems for each week. The links will be made
live as the corresponding documents are available. You are free to work as far
ahead as availability allows. The date given for each week is the date
of the Monday recitation/Q&amp;A session in which the material in that week's 
lecture notes will be reviewed.
