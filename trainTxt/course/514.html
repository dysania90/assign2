CS 596: Computational Complexity Theory

  







Computational complexity theory groups problems into classes according to
how much of particular computational resources their solutions require.
Familiar examples are P and NP, which are classes of problems solvable
with at most polynomial time with and without nondeterminism.
 


We will investigate what is known about common complexity classes which
capture such ideas as feasibility, randomized algorithms, boolean
circuits, parallel computation, and interactive proofs.
Along the way, we will learn some of the major recent results in this
area---some of which were even reported in the New York Times!

 Objectives


  To understand the approach toward classifying computational
      problems taken by structural complexity: define a class of problems
      according to computational resources required to solve them and
      investigate the relationships between these classes.
  To understand the proof techniques used to characterize the
      inherent complexity of problems in this way.
  To be familiar with significant recent results in
      computational complexity theory.
  To gain experience presenting results of a theoretical nature.
 Activities



 Activities


  Read the text and work appropriate exercises.
Note: there will be no graded homework assignments, but students are
strongly advised to work through exercises at the end of the chapters in 
the text book.
  Take mid term  examination.
  Give an oral presentation of a  significant result or paper.



 Grading:
Final grades will be determined with approximately equal weights on the midterm and 
the presentation.  
Consideration will be given to class participation for on campus students.
