 Homework Solutions 

Note: The following are postscript files. The suggested method of viewing
and printing
these files is to run Netscape from a UNIX based system with ghostscript
installed. For most of you this means running Netscape on eden, romulus or
remus while you are on an X-Term in a computer lab. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO VIEW THESE FILES FROM A PC OR VIA AOL. If you need help, please see me
during office hours or after recitation and I can show you in a lab how to 
view these solutions.



To print the solutions, do not use the print command from ghostscript
as it is broken and does not work. 
From Netscape, use shift-leftmousebutton to save the homework solution to
a file. Then from a prompt run


lpr -Pprinter filename



Where printer is the printer you wish to print to and filename is the
file you saved the marked pages as. To see a list of valid printer
names type printers.
