 IT and the Web, FYI.






ISDN networks.
What is ISDN? ISDN maximizes the transmission capability of existing
copper wires [i.e., telephone lines], allowing for the simultaneous
transmission [digital] of voice and data over a single twisted pair
connection. Its uses include telecommuting, screen sharing, desk-top
video conferencing, large file transfer and Internet access.

CD-ROM Formats
This note is an attempt to answer the oft-asked questions about CD
formats like "What is the difference between CD-DA, CD-ROM, CD-ROM/XA,
and CD-I?" and "How is Photo CD compatible with all of these?" and
"What is the difference between single-session and multi-session
discs?
