Code Examples



At the bottom of this section is a link to the directory that contains all the examples from
the lectures. The examples are arranged by lecture number. Lecture numbers are tied to the
week in which they were given, and are not numbered sequentially. For example, there is no lecture
13 (midterm!) 



In each subdirectory, you will find a host of source files (.c,.h) and executable files (.e) You will
 only  be able to browse the source files from the web. In order to run any of the executables
you will need to run them from the Unix command line. For example, in order to run pow_of_2.e from
lecture 6, you will need to execute the following command 



  $~cs1003/examples/lec06/pow_of_2.e
