Goals:
To provide the computer science student with skills to design and build expert systems tools.


Prerequisites:
CS 470, or programming in Lisp, Prolog, or other artificial intelligence languages, with applications to basic artificial intelligence tasks.


Topics:
1.&nbsp; Human problem solving and learning 
2.&nbsp; Knowledge Representation
3.&nbsp; Knowledge Documentation
4.&nbsp; Inference and Control
5.&nbsp; Languages and Tools for expert systems
6.&nbsp; Selection of Appropriate Problems
7.&nbsp; Inexact Knowledge, Fuzzy Logic, Measures of&nbsp;&nbsp; Belief
8.&nbsp; Knowledge Bases
9. Knowledge Acquisition
10. Knowledge Programming
11. Evaluation of Expert Systems


Laboratory Projects:
1.&nbsp; Each student works with a team to create an expert system using a language and tools examined in class.&nbsp; Evaluation is based on team work, documents explaining 
a.&nbsp; project history
b.&nbsp; project selection
c.&nbsp; knowledge engineering methodology
d.&nbsp; user manual
e. and the class presentations.
2.&nbsp; Knowledge base problem using Prolog
3.&nbsp; Knowledge base problem using EXSYS
