Laboratory for Molecular Robotics




Molecular Robotics is an emerging and highly  interdisciplinary
field that seeks to produce new materials and  devices at a nanometer
scale, by direct interaction with atomic  structures. Whereas
conventional chemistry relies on bulk  phenomena such as diffusion to
create self-assembling structures,  Molecular Robotics manipulates
structures by applying external  forces and precisely positioning atoms
and molecules. It is a revolutionary technology, which attempts to
provide fine control over the structure of matter, analogous to the
fine control we can now exert upon the bits and bytes of information
structures. Future  applications range from very fast and small
computers to nanorobots  and self-replicating machines. Nanorobots might
be programmed to  recognize and repair specific kinds of cells, and to
perform a large  variety of other tasks that are now impossible to
accomplish. Large  structures might be built by using massive
parallelism. The  technology has the potential for major scientific and
practical  breakthroughs. However, today we lack most of the tools
necessary  for realizing the dreams of Molecular Robotics. Research
opportunities abound.
