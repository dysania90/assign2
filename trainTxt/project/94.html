 Intelligent Systems Lab



Welcome to the Home Page of the Intelligent System Lab (ISL) at Michigan
State University.



The ISL was established in 1990 as a laboratory within the Computer Science
Department and the College of Engineering. Directed by Jon Sticklen, the
ISL is dedicated to the study of knowledge-based and other AI solutions
to real-world engineering problems.



The lab is composed of two research groups: a knowledge-based systems
group (lead by Dr. Sticklen), and a genetic algorithms and programming group
(let by Drs. Bill Punch and Erik Goodman). 



The KBS group of ISL has a five year track record of research and collaboration
with the Composites Materials Center (Eng College), the Center for Microbial
Ecology (Ag College), the Laboratory for Crop Simulation (Ag College), the
ABSP activity in genetic engineering (Ag and Nat Sci College), the Accounting
Department (Bus College), and with industry (McDonnell Douglas and Procter
&amp; Gamble). ISL-KBS sets as its main purpose the fostering of an environment
in which the search for the principles that underpin "the capture and
transfer of expert knowledge" via knowledge-based and other AI approaches
can be explored. WEB information about ISL-KBS activity is best browsed
starting from this page.



The MSU Genetic Algorithms Research and Applications Group (the GARAGe)
is a multi-disciplinary unit interested in the application of Genetic Algorithms
and Genetic Programming to real-world problems, as well as fundamental research
on GA and GP. We have a number of interesting projects, both in terms of
GA/GP fundamental research and in GA/GP applications including: parallelization
of GAs/GPs; multiple population topologies and interchange methodologies;
scheduling applications, including sponsored research on job-shop scheduling;
design applications, including sponsored research on composite material
design configuration applications, particularly physics applications of
optimal molecule configurations for particular systems like C60 (buckyballs),
plant floor layout, and others. WEB information about ISL-GA, the GARAGe
group, is best browsed starting from the page you will find by clicking
