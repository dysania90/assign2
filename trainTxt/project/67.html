IRIS Project IC-6: Intelligent Scheduling







IRIS Project IC-6: Intelligent Scheduling at SFU



The  
Intelligent Systems Lab (ISL)
at Simon Fraser University is a
participant in the 
IRIS
project IC-6 on intelligent scheduling.
The main research goal of the project is the synthesis of logic
programming, constraint reasoning, belief revision, temporal reasoning
and abductive reasoning into a viable intelligent scheduling
framework.  A more 
detailed description of the project is also available. 



There is also a brochure
available in Adobe's PDF format.




The participants 
in the project come
from Canadian universities and companies.



Some the ISL's project related 
documents are available.
