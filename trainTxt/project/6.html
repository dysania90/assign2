The Alexandria Project


 The Alexandria Project

Introduction




Welcome to the home page of the Alexandria Project.  We are a
consortium of researchers, developers, and educators, spanning the
academic, public, and private sectors, exploring a variety of problems
related to a distributed digital library for
geographically-referenced information.






Distributed means the library's components may be spread across
the Internet, as well as coexisting on a single desktop.
Geographically-referenced means that all the objects in the
library will be associated with one or more regions (``footprints'') on
the surface of the Earth.






The centerpiece of the Alexandria Project is the Alexandria Digital
Library (ADL), an online information system inspired by the Map and
Imagery Laboratory (MIL) in the 
Davidson Library at the 
University of California, Santa Barbara.  
The ADL currently provides access over the World Wide Web to a subset 
of the MIL's holdings, as well as other geographic datasets.
