Object-oriented systems at UCSB











OOCSB: Object-Oriented Compilers at UCSB

Our research group investigates compiler optimizations for
object-oriented languages, related implementation aspects (such as
dispatch mechanisms or garbage collection), and studies of the
instruction-level behavior of object-oriented programs.
 


Ok, we admit it: the "Compilers" in the acronym is a bit gratuitous
(since the group's scope goes beyond pure compiler issues), but hey,
it sure makes for a cute acronym.
