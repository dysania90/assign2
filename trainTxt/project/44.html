The Distributed Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
The Distributed Artificial Intelligence Laboratory




Welcome to the Dis Lab Web Server

The Distributed Artificial Intelligence Laboratory 
is part of the Computer Science Department

here at UMass.  You
can find specific information here about our research, 
publications, presentations, 
and personnel.

Purpose
          The Distributed AI Lab investigates the problems that arise when multiple
          agents (including computational agents and humans) interact to solve
          interrelated problems. This includes mechanisms for multi-agent coordination,
          organization, and negotiation. The Dis Lab also investigates the design of
          sophisticated individual control mechanisms for sensor interpretation, acoustic
          signal understanding, real-time scheduling, and resource-constrained scheduling.
