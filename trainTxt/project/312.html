Experimental Software Engineering Group





 

The Experimental Software Engineering Group (ESEG) of the University
of Maryland views software engineering as a laboratory science.
Specific research projects are centered around formalizing
various aspects of 
(a) the Quality Improvement Paradigm 
(QIP),
(b) the Experience Factory 
(EF), and 
(c) the Goal/Question/Metric approach 
(GQM). 

The QIP is aimed at building descriptive models of software processes,
products, and other forms of experience, experimenting with and
analyzing these models, in order to build improvement-oriented,
packaged, prescriptive models. The EF is an organizational approach
for packaging reusable software experiences and supplying them to
projects and building core competencies in software.
