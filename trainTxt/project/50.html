 UC Berkeley Digital Library Project 







The UC Berkeley Digital Library project is a 4-year, $4 million 
research project that includes faculty, staff, and students in the Computer
Science Division, the School of Information Management &amp; Systems, and
the Research Program in Environmental Planning &amp; Geographic Information 
Systems, as well as participation from several state and local
agencies and industrial partners.

The project's goal is to develop the technologies for intelligent
access to massive, distributed collections
comprising multiple terabyte databases of 
photographs, satellite images, videos, maps, full text documents, 
and "multivalent" documents.
