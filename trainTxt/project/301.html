Complex software systems today can be characterized by distribution,
heterogeneity, and changing resource requirements and capacities.
These attributes make static systems unsuitable for a wide range of tasks
that need high performance, or are long-lived.
In order to achieve high performance in such environments for more than a
short period of time, systems need to dynamically adapt to changing
resource capacities and application requirements.

We are designing and building Active Harmony, a software
architecture that supports distributed execution of computational objects
in such environments through the following innovations:


dynamic execution environment: Dynamic adaptation to network and
resource capacities, both when computational objects are created, and when
application requirements or resource capacities change.
Active Harmony will attempt to maximize data affinity and load balancing
through intelligent resource allocation and object migration.
automatic application adaptation: A framework that 
permits runtime adaptation of algorithms, data distribution, and load
balancing. 
Active Harmony will export a detailed metric interface to
applications, allowing them to access processor, network, and operating
system parameters.
Applications export tuning options to the system, which can then automatically
optimize resource allocation.
Measurement and tuning can therefore become first class objects in the
programming model.
Programmers can write applications that include ways to adapt computation to
observed performance and changing conditions.
shared-data interfaces: Active Harmony will support shared-memory
semantics among computational objects regardless of location, allowing both
peer-to-peer and client-server computations to exploit the simplified
programming model and fine-grained sharing permitted by traditional
shared-memory environments.
Innovations include support for heterogeneity of both data \emph{and}
program code, a multi-level security scheme that adapts data and code
interfaces to the degree of trust between computational objects, and
support for the dynamic execution environment.


The unique aspect of the Active Harmony work is the emphasis on adapting to
heterogeneous and changing environments.
Other researchers have studied some of the constituent issues that we plan
to address.
Our emphasis is on the inter-relationships between objects in the
system.
The primary result of this research will be an infrastructure and a set of
algorithms that permit global resource optimization under changing
conditions.

Discussion group:
We will be forming a reading and discussion group to investigate the above
issues. Check back later (week of 11/18) for details.

Open questions:

Is the fastest sequential process migration appropriate for parallel
applications? i.e. should more process state be moved prior to
re-scheduling a parallel application?
How can scheduling of parallel and client/server applications take data
affinity into account?
Is co-scheduling as important if we don't care about latency, only
throughput?
How does co-scheduling perform when we move from local networks to internets?
