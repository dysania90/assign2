This research group is involved in building high-performanceapplication-specific parallel architectures and software forheterogeneous systems.  We are currently engaged in two differentresearch efforts.  The first project MISTE,is to design and analyze hardware features that support real-timeapplications on general purpose RISC processors.Our second project is to develop a flexible compiler framework, Scale, thatcan be easily adapted to new architectures.  Once Scale is complete,we will be able to quickly build a sophisticated optimizing compilerfor our special purpose architectures.  This project is being done inconjection with the Systemsfor Advanced Architectures and Object Systems Laboratories.We have descriptions available for some of our prior researchprojects.  We developed a heterogeneous, tightly coupled systemfor real-time knowledge-based computer vision, called the Image Understanding Architecture .In conjunction with the Real-Time Systems researchgroup, we built a single-chip parallel array, called SSCoP , that implements the scheduling kernel ofthe Springreal-time operating system.We have also constructed the ARPA ImageUnderstanding Benchmark .  This benchmark is intended to measurethe appropriateness of parallel machines for image processing.  We have several pieces of software, such as the IU Benchmark,available on our anonymous FTP site.
