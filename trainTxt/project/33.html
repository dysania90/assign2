WPI Artificial Intelligence in Design Group (AIDG)






WPI Artificial Intelligence in Design Group







The AI in Design Group (AIDG) at WPI has been involved for many 
years in a variety of 

design-related projects.  Some of its research has been devoted to 

DSPL-based systems.



It tries to maintain links with other AI in Design researchers
worldwide, and keep up with their research.  Much of this information
is captured in the 
 
AI in Design Webliography, and in the 
Design Directory.




The group meets every week to discuss the research of group
members, to review papers, and to discuss research issues. 
Members of this group are also involved with 
Artificial Intelligence Research Group 
activities.
