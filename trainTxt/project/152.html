 Research Overview 



The Pablo academic research group is located at the 

Department of Computer Science

at the

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
.
Under the direction of

Professor Dan Reed
, 
the members of the group investigate the interaction of
architecture, system software, and applications on massively parallel
computer systems.
Major research topics include 

performance instrumentation and data analysis tools
,
integration of

data parallel compilers (HPF),

and performance analysis,

virtual reality techniques

for performance data immersion and real-time adaptive control,

portable parallel file system software
,
for data caching and staging experiments on parallel input/output
systems, and

input/output characterization studies
.




A variety of the group's 

papers

are available in postscript form.
A description of some of the group's computing facilities is also available.




In addition, there is more general information on the national

High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) program, 

on

the ARPA HPCC program,

and 

software and tools

for high-performance computing.
