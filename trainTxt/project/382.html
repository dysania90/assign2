 L0 - Computational modeling of
semantics and syntax




This page is under construction, and will be fleshed out with more
detailed information soon.

L0 (Also called L-zero) is a research project in computational
semantics headed by Jerry Feldman of the International Computer
Science Institute and George Lakoff of the U.C. Berkeley
Department of Linguistics.  Lokendra Shastri is
another senior researcher on the project.  




There is a mailing list for discussion of lzero issues and
announcements of lzero meetings.  It is at lzero@icsi.berkeley.edu.
To subscribe, send mail to 
lzero-request@icsi.berkeley.edu.




A Good first place to look for information is the paper Lzero:
The First Five Years.



The current set of Graduate Students working on the project is

 David Bailey
 Srini Narayan
 Jonathan Segal


The first thesis to come directly out of the L-zero project was that of Terry
Regier, who is now a professor at the University of Chicago.  His
research produced a structured connectionist model which could
learn to categorize spatial scenes with spatial prepositions from a
variety of natural languages, without using negative evidence.  A
short paper version of his research can be found as:



  Regier,
Terry (1995).  A model of the human capacity for categorizing spatial
relations, Cognitive Linguistics, vol. 6, no. 1,
pp. 63-88.



The second thesis to come directly out of the project was that of Andreas
Stolcke.  His research focussed on the bayesian learning of
probabilistic language models.  His thesis can be found as:


 Stolcke,
Andreas (1994).  Bayesian Learning
of Probabilistic Language Models (UC Berkeley thesis)
