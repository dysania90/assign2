    Where are you?

      Isaac
      The goal of the 
	Isaac project is is to unify methodologies based on
      existing technology and develop a system for simulating
      virtual microcosms populated with autonomous robots. The
      principal focus is to lay down the foundation that unifies
      eight major components; geometric modeling, model-driven
      dynamics simulation, collision detection and contact analysis,
      motion control, sensory feedback, knowledge representation
      about the environment, incremental planning and a
      load-balancing, multi-processor computational model.  The
      primary investigator for Isaac is James Cremer. 
      


    
    

 My work is centered on building the dynamics simulation
      engine for Isaac and unifying all the components into
      one usable system.  The "interactive time" constraints of the
      Isaac project necessitate highly efficient model
      representations, fast linear algebra methods, fast stable DAE
      solvers, and distribution of the simulation across processes
      and machines. 
    
    

 You can find some papers I've written about Isaac 
      here, and here is a funny "advertisement"
      related to what I do. 
        
    

    
      
    

    Linux!
	
    

 When I'm not in the lab, I can still do my research at home.  "At
        home?"  you say.  "Are you one of those strange wealthy graduate
        students with your own unbelievably expensive workstation?"  NO!
        I use Linux, the Unix operating system for personal computers!
        And you can too, for the low, low price of... free! Click
        here
 to go to Linux Links,
        where you will find links to just about anything you want to know
        about Linux, including the location of sites you can download it
        from.



    
    Pretty Good Privacy

    

 I've just started playing with the "Pretty Good Privacy" (PGP)
        system.  This allows people to get a reasonable assurance of
        authenticity and security when communicating over insecure
        networks.  I see the primary purpose of this for it's digital
        signature verification, which allows one to easily refute or
        detect forged messages.  You may have application for it's
        encryption, also.  The PGP  FAQ
         answers general questions and gives the location of the MIT
        distribution.  You can do PGP public key lookups here.
        To get my public key, either use that web interface or "finger
        phenning@cs.uiowa.edu".
