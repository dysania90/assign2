Integrated Media Systems Center 

of 
University of Southern California.




This laboratory supports research and development efforts related to
interactive computer graphics systems and immersive technologies and
applications.  Research spans fundamental technology and focused
development that enables new capabilities and applications in science and
industry.  Constructing prototype and demonstration systems enhances the
identification of critical issues and the evaluation of solutions in a real
world setting.  Students gain interdisciplinary experience and an enhanced
appreciation for the interplay between research and systems development.

Laboratory workstations include Sparc20,SGI Indy, Macintosh and PC
systems.  Networks include ethernet, FDDI, and a Gbit/sec optical fiber
link (HP Jetstream).  Immersive interfaces include a head-mounted display, Ascension
magnetic tracker, cameras, and video digitizers.
