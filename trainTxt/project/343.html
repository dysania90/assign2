 Algorithmic Development in Restricted Classes of Graphs



Many problems in graph theory are NP-complete on general graphs. In
practice one rarely has to contend with general graphs; often
information is available to limit the graphs to a restricted class.  In
particular, graphs which arise from geometric models are common.  Also
there are problems that can be solved efficiently for some of these restricted
classes (for example, maximum clique in circle graphs).  In this project we
employ various techniques including a generalized form of dynamic
programming to design polynomial time algorithms for problems on various
restricted classes of graphs.   



Sometimes graph parameters that are not generally equal are equal
for certain restricted classes . This can be useful in showing the
problems are NP-complete or in developing algorithms.  Finally, it is
useful to study new classes of  graphs, and determine for a wide variety
of problems whether they are NP-complete or not . 




 Even Adjacency Split of a Graph 


The objective is to partition the vertices of a graph into two sets
S and T such that each vertex of one set is adjacent to a vertex in the
other set, and the two sets are within one of having the same size.
Determining whether a graph has an Even Adjacency Split (EAS) is
NP-complete for general graphs.  Nevertheless there is an O(n2)
algorithm for trees, and a linear time algorithm has been found that
handles graphs where no vertex is adjacent to more than two vertices of
degree 1.  




 Fractional Graph Parameters 


For some time, it has been useful to describe graphs in terms of a
variety of parameters, for example the chromatic number, the clique
number, the independence number, the matching number, and the domination
number. All these parameters can be expressed in terms of integer
functions on the graphs. Recently several people have started to
investigate fractional variations of these parameters where the
functions map to the [0,1] real interval rather than the set of
integers. This project has been investigating the Upper Fractional
Domination Number, GAMMAf.   We have shown that GAMMAf is
always computable and rational, but in general it is NP-hard to compute
it. For trees, cycles, simplicial graphs, and 2-trees, we have shown
that GAMMAf = GAMMA (the corresponding integer problem), 
and this value is easy to compute. 
Also we have shown that for a large subclass of the class of Perfect
Graphs (the subclass is called the Strongly Perfect Graphs), four
parameters are equal.  These four parameters are beta, GAMMA,
GAMMAf, and IR, where beta is the
Independence number and IR is the Upper Irredundance number.  Other
classes of graphs have also been studied to
determine whether these parameters are equal, but generally they are
not equal.
