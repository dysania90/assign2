Sprite


The Sprite Operating System

New address!
The new address for these pages is 





Sprite is a research operating system developed at the University of
California, Berkeley, by John Ousterhout's research group.



Sprite is
a distributed operating system that provides a single system image to
a cluster of workstations.  It provides very high file system performance
through client and server caching.  It has process migration to take
advantage of idle machines.  It was used as a testbed for research in
log-structured file systems, striped file systems, crash recovery, and
RAID file systems, among other things.



The Sprite project has now ended, although Sprite is still running on a
few machines.  If you have a DECstation 5000/200 or a SparcStation 2, you
could try running Sprite off the Sprite CD-ROM.



John Ousterhout has a retrospective
on the Sprite project.
