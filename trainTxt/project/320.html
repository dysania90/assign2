Project GIMME



GIMME -- Graphical Interfaces for MultiMedia Environments


directed by


Prof. Joseph A. Konstan

Department of Computer Science

University of Minnesota



 Project GIMME explores all aspects of graphical user interfaces and the application of user interface
technology to multimedia systems and applications.  The project has three key components: 



Developments in the core of user interface toolkits (e.g., constraint programming developments).
Developments in multimedia systems and toolkits (e.g., the command stream and SynchMe multimedia toolkit).
Applications and joint research projects.



The joint research projects include GroupLens collaborative filtering for Usenet News (with John Riedl) and the 
Brain Neighborhood Viewer for multiple stacks of montaged brain microscopy images (with John Carlis).  Applications include
a wide range of collaborations on transportation, physics, counseling and other areas.







Here is a list of individual projects and the people working on them:
