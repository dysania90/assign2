   Research Interests 





The numerical computation research group is concerned with
developing, analyzing, implementing, and testing methods for
solving mathematical problems on computers.  It is also
concerned with applications of numerical methods to scientific
and engineering applications, and with languages and tools 
for numerical computation.  There is considerable emphasis
on the development of methods for parallel computers.




Specific areas of emphasis within the group include optimization
and nonlinear equations (Byrd, Schnabel), partial differential
equations (Cai, McBryan), eigenvalue problems (Jessup), and
languages and tools for parallel computation (Jessup, Schnabel).
Currently there is also considerable emphasis on applications
from molecular chemistry (Byrd, Schnabel), astrophysics (McBryan),
space structures (McBryan), and combustion and chaotic systems (Bradley).
