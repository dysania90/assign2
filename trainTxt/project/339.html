The TIBBIT Project






Timing Insensitive Binary to 
Binary Translation


The TIBBIT project focuses on performing automated binary-code translation 
and migration of applications across widely different architectures, and
automatically compensating for implicit time-based dependencies between 
the application and the speed of the underlying hardware.  The TIBBIT project 
is primarily concerned with the automated migration of embedded real-time 
applications.



An example
of why TIBBIT is necessary







TIBBIT project participants:



TIBBIT is being developed cooperatively between Carnegie Mellon University 
(CMU) and the University of Oregon 
(UO).

Our sponsors:


TIBBIT is a part of the RASSP program
sponsored by ARPA and administered through Wright Laboratory.

This research is in cooperation with 

Martin Marietta Labs.





TIBBIT progress reports.
We send these to RASSP every month.
