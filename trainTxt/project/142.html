Concurrent Systems Architecture Group (CSAG)



Research in CSAG focuses on hardware and software architecture issues in
parallel computer systems (e.g. MPP's, scalable servers, and clusters of high
performance workstations).  Computer systems design involves a cooperative
effort between software and hardware designers; our research efforts reflect
this blend, including efforts to build parallel programming systems, scalable
input/output systems, and high speed communication software and hardware.
These projects emphasize the development of innovative designs and their
evaluation, based on actual implementations.  CSAG is led by Andrew Chien.
