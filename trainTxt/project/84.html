TITAN: A Next-Generation Infrastructure for Integrating Computing and Communication



TITAN: A Next-Generation Infrastructure for Integrating Computing and Communication

Funded by the National Science Foundation CISE Institutional Infrastructure Program



The Computer Science faculty at the University of California at Berkeley
is developing as its computing and communication
infrastructure a new type of computing system, called Titan.  This
computing system comprises an integrated ensemble of computing and
communication elements, organized to provide the user with a number of
services that we think will characterize the practice of computing into
the next century.  The most important of these are (i) multimedia
(especially video) capabilities in delivery vehicles, storage and
communication, (ii) huge computing power (especially from clusters
of workstations operating as a single parallel computer) and enormous
storage space, (iii) innovative parallel languages, debuggers, and
libraries, and (iv) high accessibility from mobile as well as fixed
locations.
