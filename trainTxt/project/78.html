The Ensemble Project


Ensemble

The Ensemble Project is a research effort in the
Computer Science Division
of the
University of California, Berkeley. 
The principal investigators are 
Professors

Susan Graham and

Michael Harrison.




We are investigating the use of the latest programming language technology
for the task of software construction and maintenance. Our ultimate goal is
a high quality development environment emphasizing the editing and
integration of all artifacts of the software life cycle: programs,
documentation, specification, performance analyses, etc., as well as the
creation and maintenance of software content.  Software artifacts are
regarded as structured multimedia documents, where the structure and
semantics are essential to understanding the document content. Current
advances in incremental analysis and maintenance of document structure,
semantics, and content allow us to develop new technology for editing
structured documents and presenting multimedia.

Meet the students who work on the Ensemble Project. 


See what our alumnus and collaborator Professor Ethan
Munson is working on. 


One of these days we'll get our act together and make the bits for our publications
available in one place. For the moment, you can check out our list of publications and get copies from the library
if you need anything. 


We've got a list of interesting projects
available for enterprising undergraduates or Masters students.
