Scientific visualization combines computer-based vision with advanced
techniques in geometric modeling, rendering, animation, and virtual reality.
The result is a visual technology that offers new solutions to challenging 
scientific and engineering problems.



Directed by Dr. Bruce 
H. McCormick, the Scientific Visualization Laboratory is affiliated with
the Computer Science Division of the Texas Engineering Experiment Station 
(TEES).  The laboratory is part of the 
Texas A&amp;M University
and is located in the H. R. Bright Building on the College Station campus.




The Laboratory is focusing on scientific visualization and
modeling for three application areas:


	
	Gaze-contingent visual communication,




	
	Brain mapping, and




	
	Modeling and visualization of large-scale networks.
