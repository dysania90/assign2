 UCLA VLSI CAD LAB HOME PAGE




UCLA VLSI CAD LAB



This laboratory is used to investigate computer-aided design
of VLSI circuits and systems.  Areas include logic synthesis,
technology mapping, physical design, testing, and yield 
enhancement for various VLSI technologies such as standard cells,
gate arrays, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and
multi-chip modules (MCMs).  Other areas of study include a
structural theory of the large-scale global optimizations
which arise in VLSI CAD.
