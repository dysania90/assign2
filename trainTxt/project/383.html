 Caltech Infospheres Project  

  Bringing Theory to the Marketplace 







 The Caltech Infospheres Project deals with the
theory and implementation of compositional systems that support
peer-to-peer communication among persistent multithreaded distributed
objects. Though our implementation of a generic distributed system uses
Java, TCP/IP, and the Web, the ideas are directly applicable to any
distributed (possibly object-oriented) system that supports messages and
threads.  A key concern is the development of reliable distributed
applications by composing existing and created software components in
structured ways.  We are solving the problems and influencing the
standards of distributed component technology for the user and developer
for the Internet of the 21st century.

 An  executive
summary  of the Infospheres Project is available. 

 

 Release 1.0b1 of the
Infosphere Infrastructure (II) is now available! 



 The Caltech Infospheres Infrastructure (II) is a distributed system
framework that is implemented in Java.  It provides a generic object
model and a variety of messaging models (asynchronous, synchronous,
and remote procedure calls).  This system is freely available, so
that researchers and developers can develop lightweight distributed
systems that can leverage open standards and the World Wide Web.
Caltech is developing methodologies that take advantage of the
system's design so that reasoning on entire distributed systems is
feasible.  With these methodologies, one can say something about the
reliability, completeness, and robustness of a distributed system as a
whole.  The II is being extended to support interoperability with
other distributed system models and to utilize emerging standards in
the Java domain.  Because the system is designed and implemented in a
generic manner, the ideas, algorithms, and theories developed within
the II framework are directly applicable to existing distributed
systems and frameworks.





 The 
Caltech Infospheres Project  is part of the Compositional
Systems Research Group of the  Center for Research on Parallel
Computation, led by Professor
K. Mani Chandy.  Other projects in which the Compositional Systems
group works include 
Problem Solving
Environments,
Archetypes, and our

Infosphere Infrastructure.





 The contributions of the Infospheres Group are both theoretical
and experimental.  We have an extensive set of 
papers , and our Infosphere
Infrastructure is available for non-commercial purposes.  Our
first major code release (1.0a) was made available on August 26th,
1996.

Note that this is an internal mailing list and goes to all group
members.  Bug reports can be sent to info-bugs@cs.caltech.edu.





 The Infospheres Project is sponsored by the CISE directorate of the
 National Science Foundation  under

Problem Solving Environments  grant  CCR-9527130
, the Center for Research in Parallel Computing under grant NSF
CCR-9120008, and by Novell, Inc.
The formal methods and adaptivity (reliability, mobility, security)
parts of the project are sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific
Research under grant AFOSR 91-0070.
