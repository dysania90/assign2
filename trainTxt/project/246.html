Introduction

The style of traditional programming is imperative:
a program instructs the computer
how to accomplish a task, for instance, how to sort a list.
On the other hand, logic programming opens a possibility of declarative
programming, i.e. writing programs which just tell the computer
what final state is desired, for instance, 
what is meant by a sorted list. A logic program should be written 
as a set of logical definitions (declarations, specifications.) 
The same program should be interpreted by a computer as a set of imperative procedures. After the program is ready, the programmer may wish to consider its imperative meaning, and add control structures to improve the efficiency.



This research project is concerned with designing a logic programming 
system which could offer the programmer a wide expressive power 
and minimize the need for thinking about the procedural meaning of the
program. It includes the development of a theory and an experimental
implementation.




Abstract


We propose creating a family of logic programming languages -- one for
general purpose programming, and the others specialized and aimed
at major application areas of artificial intelligence. The languages
will be fully declarative, and based on solid mathematical
foundations.



The language for general purpose programming  will admit (unlike
PROLOG) extended syntax: general quantifiers, and a functional
form of classical negation. This language will be the basis from which
the others are developed.  The language for expert systems will have
intrinsic support for non-numerical measures of confidence, and
formal mechanisms for handling hierarchies of contradictions.  The
language for deductive databases will support multiple open and closed
domains and efficient query evaluation.  The fourth language will combine features of the previous two will be
suitable for distributed multi-component intelligent systems.  The languages will have a potential for parallelization.



No languages with such features currently exist, and we believe that
their availability  would have a desirable impact on the construction
of future intelligent systems.
