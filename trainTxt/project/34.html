The Data/Knowledge Base Research Laboratory supports research in very
large data and knowledge base systems, and scientific databases.  With
recent funding from NSF and IBM, the Laboratory serves as the testbed
for the Gaea Project.  




Recent research projects have included visual
browsing and query interface design, distributing scientific
computation and databases over a network, temporal modeling, and
development of "Derivation Networks" that can represent complex
computational processes.  




The laboratory's hardware includes a
DECstation 5000/200, a Sun SPARCstation, a SGI Indigo Elan. 
Software includes GRASS, Khoros, and Data Explorer
packages and Postgres and ObjectStore database management systems.
