The Real-Time Systems Laboratory at UIUC
The Real-Time Systems Laboratory (RTSL) performs research on all
aspects of real-time computing systems.  A real-time system must not
only produce logically correct results, but it must also produce them
with certain timing constraints.  Such systems are gaining
importance in a number of applications: automated factories,
telecommunication systems, defense systems, and space systems, for
example.




Calendar
  During the semester the RTSL meets each week, Wednesdays at 4:00, and a
  speaker gives a talk on a subject related to real-time systems.
  See the Calendar page for more information.




Publications
  The Publications page has a bibliography
  of the RTSL's recent publications, as well as the
  PostScript source for many of these papers.






Members
      Many of the members of the RTSL have personal web pages.






Software Distribution
  See the Software Distribution page for more
  information about obtaining PERTS, our real-time
  prototyping environment, and DRTSS, our simulator for real-time systems.
