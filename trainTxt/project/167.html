The InfoLab Systems Group develops agents that answer your questions
on the World Wide Web in ordinary English.  More generally, our agents
connect information seekers to information sources via natural
language.  The seekers are usually people, but may be computers.  The
sources are usually computers, but may be people.  Sources provide
information in a variety of media, such as text, photographs, audio,
and video.





Most of our agents are centered on the START natural language system
developed by Boris Katz at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
START uses information annotations -- in the form of natural language
sentences and phrases -- as retrieval-enabling handles.







Our Globe Server answers questions about
weather reports, maps and other geographical questions, and our AI Lab Server answers questions about MIT's
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, including questions about the
people who work here and the research they do.  We will soon be adding
a News Server which has connections to multiple news sources
and answers questions about daily news.
