The Duke CS PerlJaM/AdvIL page






















The Duke Computer Science
PerlJaM/AdvIL Page


















Welcome to the home page of the Duke CS languages group,
alternately known as 

Perl JaM [PERL, JAva, Modula-3], and/or

AdvIL
[ADVanced (Interpreted | Interesting | Inestimable | Invulnerable
| Inscrutable | Insufferable | Indispensable | Inevitable) Languages].

Purpose
The purpose of this group is to learn, use, and discuss the current crop
of new and interesting languages.
Our current focus is to be determined.
Our original goal was to enter Sun's
Java Cup International.

Meetings
TBA

Java info
Sun's official Java site.
     Lots o' information, and includes some of the links below.

 Beginners:

 The Sun Java Tutorial
     from java.sun.com.
 My 
     local cached copy of the Sun Java tutorial
     for fast access (last updated July 9).

 Non-beginners:

 The Java API
     is extremely useful to have open in a second browsing
     window while you program.
 Ashish's
     
     local cached copy of the above, or
     Surendar's
     
     local cached copy of the above.
 A set of excellent
     
     postscript diagrams of the Java Beta class hierarchy.
     If you're on a Duke CS machine, I have them in
     ~gadde/public_html/Java/diagrams_beta.

     Also, the 
     text list of the class hierarchy from the API.
     Both are very useful when you don't know where a class lives
     (or even what it's called).
 
     AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) Tutorial.

 Neat stuff:

 Gamelan,
     the Java demo site.
 Everything you wanted to know
     about MUDs
     and 
     MUDs on the web.

 Java Networking examples and source

 
     Simple Java Sockets
 
     Thingtone's Java Workshop (good stuff here)
