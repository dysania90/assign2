The ScaLAPACK project is a collaborative effort between:

Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Rice University
University of California, Berkeley
University of California, Los Angeles
University of Illinois
University of Tennessee, Knoxville




The ScaLAPACK project is made up of 4 components:

dense matrix software (ScaLAPACK)
large sparse eigenvalue software (PARPACK)
sparse direct systems software (CAPSS)
preconditioners for large sparse iterative solvers (PARPRE)




ScaLAPACK,
version 1.4, includes routines for the solution of dense,
band, and tridiagonal linear systems of equations, condition estimation and
iterative refinement, for LU and Cholesky factorization, matrix inversion,
full-rank linear least squares problems, orthogonal and generalized orthogonal
factorizations, orthogonal transformation routines, reductions to upper
Hessenberg, bidiagonal and tridiagonal form, reduction of a symmetric-definite/
Hermitian-definite generalized eigenproblem to standard form, the
symmetric/Hermitian, generalized symmetric/Hermitian, and the nonsymmetric
eigenproblem.



Software is available in single precision real, double precision real,
single precision complex, and double precision complex.  The software has
been written to be portable across a wide range of distributed-memory
environments such as the Cray T3, IBM SP, Intel series, TM CM-5,
clusters of workstations, and any system for which 
PVM
or MPI is available.



A draft of the
ScaLAPACK Users' Guide and a comprehensive
Installation Guide is
provided, as well as test suites for all ScaLAPACK,
PBLAS, and
BLACS routines.



Future releases of
 ScaLAPACK will include routines for the solution of
general banded linear systems, general and symmetric positive definite
tridiagonal systems, rank-deficient linear least squares problems,
generalized linear least squares problems, and the singular value
decomposition.  Also available will be the full-index PBLAS, which will
have the majority of alignment restrictions removed, as well as the
ability to operate on partial first blocks.  The next release of
ScaLAPACK is slated for Fall, 1996.



PARPACK (Parallel ARPACK) is an extension of the ARPACK software
package used for solving large scale eigenvalue problems on distributed memory
parallel architectures.  The message passing layers currently supported
are BLACS
and MPI.  Serial ARPACK must be
retrieved and installed prior to installing PARPACK.  All core
ARPACK routines
are available in single precision real, double precision real, single
precision complex, and double precision complex.  An extensive set of driver
routines are available for ARPACK and a subset of these are available
for parallel computation with PARPACK.  These may be used as templates
that are easily modified to construct a problem specific parallel interface to
PARPACK.



CAPSS is a fully parallel package to solve a sparse linear system of
the form Ax=b on a message passing multiprocessor; the matrix A is assumed to
be symmetric positive definite and associated with a mesh in two or three
dimensions.  This version has been tested on the  Intel Paragon and makes
possible efficient parallel solution for several right hand side vectors.



PARPRE is
a package of parallel preconditioners for general sparse
matrices. It includes classical point/block relaxation methods,
generalised block SSOR preconditioners (this includes ILU), and domain
decomposition methods (additive and multiplicative Schwarz, Schur
complement).  The communication protocol is
MPI, and low level
routines from the Petsc library are used, but installing the complete
Petsc library is not necessary.



Funding for this effort comes in part from DARPA, DOE, NSF, and CRPC.
