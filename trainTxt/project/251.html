Project's Goals and Approach


Research in resource management in metacomputing environments for reliable 
high-performance computing. Current focus is on fault-tolerant and load-balanced parallel 
computing on COTS networks of COTS computers running COTS systems software. At 
the core of the system lies an integrated set of simple techniques developed in previous 
foundational research, most notably the eager scheduling and the Two-Phase Idempotent 
Execution Strategy.


Calypso is a collaborative research project between New York University and Arizona 
State University.


You can look at: 

A transparencies-based presentation describing the Calypso research project as of 
spring 1996.
A set of publications relating to the project in the Postscript format. 



Please address questions to: Zvi M. Kedem; you can also send email. 
Status


We have several prototypes with the following basic set of functionalities:

Simple programming model
Simple syntax
Distributed shared memory
Transparent load balancing
Transparent fault tolerance



The working systems are:

A Unix-based system implemented on Sun/OS, Sun/Solaris, and Linux. It has not 
been released, but you can read a paper about it.
A Window NT / Windows 95 system, which has been released, please see the ASU 
Calypso Web Site for full details, or a brief description on this site.
A stand-alone Java application based on the core techniques that underlie Calypso 
with a novel implementation of shared memory. It has not been released, but you can 
read a paper about it.

Would you like to see a calypso?


Recently, we saw some nice photographs.
