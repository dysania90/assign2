The goal of the BRASS research group, headed by John Wawrzynek,
is to expand the set of applications for which reconfigurable
computing is the best solution.  We are working towards this
goal by improving both reconfigurable architectures and the compilers
for them.



Specifically, we are investigating the integration of processors and
reconfigurable logic.  We are currently developing the Garp chip,
which combines a MIPS-II processor with a fine-grained FPGA coprocessor
on the same die (see Current Projects);
we plan to investigate other architectures as well.  This area is
being actively investigated by many groups around the world; here is a
summary of past and present efforts.



We are working in cooperation with the IRAM (Intelligent DRAM) research group in our department.
The IRAM group's co-principle investigators are
Tom Anderson, Dave Patterson, and Kathy Yelick.
Having DRAM on the same die will help supply the increased memory
bandwidth demanded by both the increased processing power and
the dynamic loading of configurations.




The BRASS and IRAM groups will hold their next joint
retreat
on January 13-15, 1997.
