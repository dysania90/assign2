Coordination Page


  Coordination in Parallel Programs







Coordination refers to those features of parallel programs
involving multiple processes, namely communication, synchronization,
and scheduling. For simple programs with regular data access patterns,
coordination structures can be determined at compile time and require
little runtime support.  For applications with irregular data access
patterns, for example, loops that iterate over portions of an array or
dynamic data structures, some coordination decisions are best left
until runtime, necessitating more powerful runtime support and more
sophisticated compile-time analysis. In this project, coordination is
provided by Delirium, a coordination language for expressing
scheduling and communication patterns, by adaptive runtime scheduling,
and by Multipol, a 
distributed data structure library.




Some of the software developed in this project is being integrated 
with other parallel software efforts at Berkeley through the 
Castle Project.

Application studies are used extensively in this project
to test our ideas.  Some of the recent applications include:
the Grobner basis problem, timing level circuit simulation, 
the phylogeny problem, magnet simulation, and cell simulation.  
Here is a short movie from the cell 
simulation, which shows platelets flowing through an artery.






Here are some of the talks
and papers related to the 
Coordination project.
