Members of the Computational Vision Lab at SFU conduct research into 
machine vision and image processing, with emphasis on computational models
of colour vision.

Overview 






 

 






Images for Automated Gesture Tracking 





 Computational Vision can be thought of as enabling
computers to use visual information.  Like many problems in Artificial
Intelligence, it's something people do so easily they barely think
about it, but a very complex problem for a machine.  





Our primary focus in the Vision Lab at SFU is in understanding
colour: How are colours perceived? How can colours be reproduced accurately
on different media? In what ways does colour help in understanding images? 
Understanding colour is a much more difficult problem than most people
suspect. Often poor colour rendition results more from our limited
understanding of colour perception than it does from limitations of our
colour producing devices. 




We subscribe to a computational view of colour; namely, that human
perception and use of colour can be explored and explained as
computations.  The fundamental problem of colour is to explain how we
see colours as relatively stable despite the fact that the light
reflected into our eyes from an object varies dramatically with the
light illuminating the object. Colour and computers have become much
more intertwined in recent years as colour displays and colour
printers have become more affordable. Since colour is a perceptual,
not a physical quality, it is crucial to have a good model of how we
perceive colour in complex environments if we are to get predictable
results from these devices.





Colours are difficult to reproduce correctly, but why?  While we've
all experienced untrue colour while using home video cameras or
viewing prints from our local photofinisher, now we have colour
printers frustrating us with colours that look very little like the
nice colours we previewed on our CRTs.  When the colour doesn't look
right, it's natural to feel that the printer and monitor are not
calibrated properly--- and of course perhaps they're not--- but that's
not the fundamental problem.  The fundamental problem stems from the
fact that colour reproduction, simply is not a matter of reproducing
identical physical phenomena, as it is in the case of sound
reproduction in which a similar pattern of sound waves is recreated,
but rather a matter of creating perceptual equivalences.




For us to build machines that reproduce colours accurately or to make
effective use of colour in robotics requires that we understand human colour
perception; and the last decade has produced many interesting new
computational theories of colour coming from both computer science and
psychology. A central concern of these theories is to describe how colour
depends or does not depend on the incident illumination.  A coloured surface
cannot be seen unless we shine some light on it, but the spectrum of the
reflected light depends on the product of the spectrum of the incident
light's spectrum and the surface's reflectance.  It's natural to think of a
surface's colour as a feature of the surface itself, but the spectrum of the
light energy reaching the eye has the two factors of illumination and
reflectance confounded into one. In order to determine the true surface
properties, the effect of the illumination must be taken into account. 



 
 Colour Correction Results 










 In the upper left is the image of a scene taken under an orangish,
tungsten light which has the effect of turning the background overly
green and the whites a bit yellow. In the bottom right is the target
image of the same scene but under the standard illumination for which
the camera is calibrated. Since we cannot always control the
illumination, our goal is to correct automatically the colours in the
input image so that they will look like those in the target
image. (The fuzziness of the images is due to a high JPEG compression
factor--- concentrate on the colours.)



 The top right is a 'corrected' image produced by the standard
grey-world colour balancing algorithm, which assumes that the average
of all the colours in the scene is grey.  In the bottom left is the
much better result produced by our new, more sophisticated algorithm
developed in the Vision Lab.  As you can see, the result of our new
algorithm is much closer to the target image than that produced by
the grey-world algorithm.
