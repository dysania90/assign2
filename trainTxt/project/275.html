ADEPT







Ada 95 Distributed Execution and Partitioning Toolset


The ADEPT project team has implemented
a set of tools for configuring and building distributed Ada
programs.  These tools are consistent with the Ada 95
Distributed Systems Annex, and
have been designed for use with the
NYU GNU Ada 95 compiler (GNAT). 
The ADEPT project is funded by Computer Sciences Corporation.



ADEPT includes a graphical tool for partitioning and configuring 
Ada 95 distributed programs (the PCT), which runs on Sun Sparcs running 
the Solaris 2.4 and 2.5 operating systems. It also includes a Partition
Communication System (PCS), originally developed by France Telecom and
modified by Texas A&amp;M, designed to support multiple protocols,
including TCP/IP.  Untested sources for a Windows NT version of the PCS
are also available.  



A demonstration of ADEPT was conducted at the CSC Solutions Business 
Conference in Dallas Tx, on July 19, 1996.  The demonstration
featured two examples of distributed Ada programs executing across a network of
Sun SPARC workstations: the familiar Mandelbrot image generator,
and a simple prototype of the AEGIS Weapons System geometric server. 
Because of the increasing 
interest in the use of Java, the distributed Ada programs were connected to a 
Java application that performed all the graphical display tasks. This is 
believed to be the first demonstration of a distributed application comprising
Ada and Java components.



The future direction of ADEPT  (renamed Advanced Distributed Engineering and 
Programming Toolset) is to provide Ada/Java interoperability by allowing Java 
clients to access Ada servers using their respective distributed object models.
This means that a Java client may use the Java Remote Method Invocation to call
distributed/remote objects that have been created using Annex E in an Ada 
server. The use of Ada and Java in these roles may provide the basis for 
solving many of the distributed application problems of the future.
