The MIT Leg Laboratory



 Welcome! 

The Leg Lab at the MIT  Artificial Intelligence Lab is
dedicated to studying and building legged locomotion. We are
specialists in the exploring the roles of balance and dynamic control
--- in other words, our robots really run, walk and hop, like mammals
and birds.




We have three reasons for pursuing this research:


 Very little of the world is accessable by wheels (this is even
true of our own homes!)  Legged robots are useful for everything from
exploring inaccessible or hazardous locations to providing service or
entertainement in the places we live and work.
 Understanding how humans and other animals walk is interesting
scientifically and important medically.  We do research in natural
legged creatures and then model them both in simulation and in real
robots. 
 It's lots of fun!  Not only are our robots fun to work with,
but they're pretty entertaining to watch (we think!)  Be sure to 
check out the videos on the real and simulated robot's web pages.
