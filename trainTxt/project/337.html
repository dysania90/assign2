Wearable Computing Research Group


The University of Oregon is actively involved in the field of wearable
computing. We are funded under a grant by NSF to pursue several
concepts related to the wearable field.  


 
Our research goal is to gain an understanding of the 
technical and user-interface issues of wearable computing. More concretely, 
our research can be categorized into the following broad areas: 






  Developing wearable applications for fielding.
 The most current effort is the NetMan project, a
     virtual aide to installing computer LANs. There is also work being done with the US Army and the Marine
     Corps to develop systems for their use in the near future. 



  Evaluating wearable applications under development in a number of areas.


The goal of this effort is to
     extract the common features of the systems. This information will be used later in our development of a
     common software system for wearable computers. 



  Designing a common software "backplane" that can rapidly be reconfigured to perform a variety of tasks.

     We are attemtpting to develop a commercially acceptable system that will support the hardware being
     developed by a variety of vendors in many applications. Our first result is a software framework which we call Functionality-On-Demand.
For more details check the Achilles project home page. 
Our library of software tools continues to grow, as we study more applications. 




  Tackling the theoretical problem of the limitations of a wearable system.
 
Communications throughput,
     processing speed, and organization of data are three obvious limitations of any wearable application. What
     expectations can we have about systems that are designed today with the internet in its current state,
     versus a wearable system in the next five years? 
This is a highly fascinating topic being pursued by one of our PhD students.
