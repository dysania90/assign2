Project Overview




Microprocessors and memories are made on distinct manufacturing lines,
yielding 10M transistor microprocessors and 256M transistor DRAMs. One of the
biggest performance challenge today is the speed mismatch between the
microprocessors and memory. To address this challenge, we predict that over the
next decade processors and memory will be merged onto a single chip. Not only
will this narrow or altogether remove the processor-memory performance gap, it
will have the following additional benefits: provide an ideal building-block
for parallel processing, amortize the costs of fabrication lines, and better
utilize the phenomenal number of transistors that can be placed on a single
chip. Let's dub it an "IRAM", standing for Intelligent RAM, since most of
transistors on this merged chip will be devoted to memory.




Whereas current microprocessors rely on hundreds of wires to connect to
external memory chips, IRAMs will need no more than computer network
connections and a power plug. All input/output devices will be linked to them
via networks, as will be other IRAMs. If they need more memory, they get more
processing power as well, and vice versa -- an arrangement that will keep the
memory capacity and processor speed in balance.




A single gigabit IRAM should have an internal memory bandwidth of nearly 1000
gigabits per second (32K bits in 50 ns), a hundredfold increase over the
fastest computers today. Off-chip accesses will go over 1 gigabit per second
serial links. Hence the fastest programs will keep most memory accesses within
a single IRAM, rewarding compact representations of code and data.




History




The initial efforts of the IRAM project were undertaken during the Spring 1996
offerring of CS 294-4 at UC Berkeley.  This advanced graduate course, led by
Prof. David Patterson, 
re-examined the design of hardware and software that is
based on the traditional separation of the memory and the processor.  The 

course web page 
contains a considerable amount of useful information, including copies of
slides from many guest speakers as well as the results from three sets of

projects performed by more than a dozen graduate students.  An earlier
discussion that helped lead to the development of this course can be found in
the
article
"Microprocessors in 2020", by Dave Patterson, in the September
1995 issue (pages 48-51), of Scientific American.




Related Work




IRAM's large improvement in memory system bandwidth has significant potential
for helpng configurable systems to achieve their full performance potential.
Configurable systems offer improved performance by adapting processing
capabilities to application-specific needs.  But by making the processing
portion of an application go faster, a conventional memory system will be more
and more of a drag on performance.  Memory bandwidth is also the performance
bottleneck to rapid reprogramming of the configurable elements.  For these
reasons, the IRAM group is working closely with the
BRASS
(Berkeley Reconfigurable Architecture, Systems and Software) group, headed by
Prof. John Wawrzynek.
