Overview

The Intelligent Systems Lab is a research and development lab at
Simon Fraser University
under the auspices of both the 
School of Computing Science,
and the Centre for Systems Science.
We conduct research in artificial intelligence including constraint reasoning,
heuristic search, and intelligent agents. We apply these techniques
to applications in planning and scheduling, configuration, and
user-interfaces. Some of our
projects include the following applications.



   Intelligent Scheduling
   Forest Treatment Scheduling
   Staff Scheduling
   Vehicle Routing
   Sound Equalization
