Our research group is focusing on a number
of fundamental issues related to the design of
novel algorithms, protocols and architectures that enable
efficient fault-tolerant parallel and distributed
computing for scientific and commercial applications.

This research program is a blend of basic research and
experimental systems activities, creating a balance between
theory and practice.
The experimental activities
are centered in the 

laboratory 

for fault-tolerant parallel
and distributed computing, which includes
a cluster of powerful workstations all connected
via communication hubs consisting of high-speed interconnects.

The scope of the program consists of the following
highly interrelated topics:






Efficient parallel computing over distributed environments






Fault-tolerant parallel/distributed computing






Novel models for computing inspired by neural networks






Projects:






RAIN (Reliable Array of Independent Nodes)





Publications:






Electronic Technical Reports
