The Tenet Group

Welcome to the home page of the Tenet Group!



We are a research group exploring issues in real-time and
high-performance computer networks.  Our main focus is on the design
and development of real-time communication services and on network
support for continuous media applications such as video conferencing.
We are affiliated with both the Computer Science Division at the
University of California at Berkeley and the International Computer Science
Institute, also in Berkeley.  Our members include faculty and students
(both graduate and undergraduate) at UC Berkeley and visitors and
staff researchers at ICSI.
