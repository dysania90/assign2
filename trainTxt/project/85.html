 The Titanium Project
 





The Titanium group is developing compiler and language support for
parallel programming of distributed memory multiprocessors.  We are
designing program analysis techniques and transformations for
explicitly parallel programs and are working on a prototype compiler
that applies these optimizations.  The language is a small extension
to C, using the 
Split-C language as a starting point.
