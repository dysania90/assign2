The InfoPad WWW Server




The goal of the InfoPad research project is to
develop the hardware, software and mobile network support which will allow
ubiquitous, wireless access of realtime
multimedia data from high speed networks
using an inexpensive, portable terminal. It in effect is a "network terminal",
but with the additional capability of portability.
The most recent descriptions of the project can be found in the
 student summaries 
, in these  slides  and this recent 
 overview .





This work is primarily funded by  ARPA 
with additional support from our
industrial partners which include
 Intel ,
 IBM , 
 Ericsson ,
 Motorola ,
 National Semiconductor  and  Texas Instruments .



We are all part of the

Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department
at the

University of California, Berkeley.
