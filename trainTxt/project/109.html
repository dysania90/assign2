"The Virtual World Data Server Project"
is a three years 2.1 million dollar project
funded under the NSF HPCC Multidisciplinary Challenge Program.




The project is to expand 3D interactive simulations and virtual
world models to disk based storage. Today, virtually all such systems
require that the model data fit in main memory. The project has many
aspects including the design of appropriate storage structures,
real time delivery of model data in response to user actions,
inclusion of quality-of-service tradeoffs into resource management,
and many others.




The applications to be explicitly addressed in the project
span a range including

urban simulation models

Department of Architecture and Urban Design
,

3D interactive visualization of plasma physics data

from 

Physics Department
and, from the medial domain, virtual aneursm work.




The storage server will be designed and implemented in the

Computer Science Department 
and will serve, over ATM lines, users at the department of architecture
and at the plasma physics lab as well as locally for the aneurysm
research.




Aside from adapting
and interfacing the above existing applications to the storage server,
we will also work on the actual design of the storage
server and integration of the auxiliary databases. With respect to the
integration of spatial databases we will be exploring novel uses of the
3D interactive capability both as a query mechanism and as a form of
presentation of responses to queries.
