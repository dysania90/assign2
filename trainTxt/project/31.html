   The NYU Ultracomputer Project   

  The NYU Ultracomputer Lab conducts research in parallel computer
 architecture and software design.  Specifically, we have constructed two
 generations of shared memory machines: an 8 processor bus-based machine in the
 1980's and, our current prototype, a 16 processor, 16 memory-module machine
 with custom VLSI switches supporting the Fetch-and-Add coordination primitive.
  This design allows for a reduction in memory hot-spot contention by
 interleaving memory addresses between the memory modules, and using the
 network switches to combine requests destined for the same memory location.
  The Ultracomputer runs Symunix, a locally developed, parallel version of Unix.
