 The Utah Verifier (UV) Project: Formal Methods in System Design and Verification

Synopsis





The process of designing modern digital hardware systems
(e.g. multiprocessors) is quite challenging in many ways,
especially in terms of correctness problems that must be
solved. Projects in this area last several years with large
group sizes, and constantly face changing requirements,
personnel turnover, as well as newly unearthed (and often
unanticipated) facts. Applying today's verification tools to
verify entire systems of this nature requires inordinate
amounts of human effort as well as computer resources.





Under a DARPA award, the Utah Verifier (UV) project hopes
to address and solve some of the problems in making formal
verification techniques apply to problems of industrial scale.
Our ideas are being developed in the context of real systems projects such as
 Avalanche .
Specific activities to date include efficient explicit enumeration methods
based on new partial-order reduction methods, and model checking of non-trivial
industrial bus specifications. Specific activities planned include
creation of the following suite of verification tools, explained below.



The UV System Block Diagram

 




 PV: A Protocol Verifier 





PV will accept descriptions in an extended subset of the
PROtocol ModEling LAnguage (Promela) 
with key extensions in the area of incorporating
abstract data types and uninterpreted functions.
It will employ efficient
on-the-fly explicit enumeration algorithms.
A unique feature of PV will be its support
for refining high-level protocol descriptions
that assume infinitely sized communication buffers to
those that use finite- (and/or shared) buffers.



 CV: A Cycle-level Verifier 





CV will accept descriptions
in an extended subset of Verilog, with
key extensions in the area of incorporating
abstract data types.
It will perform implicit enumeration efficiently, using
recently developed graph representations of logic functions
such as Multiway Decision Graphs (Corella et. al.).
CV will also support many pragmatically motivated
features including a facility to accept test vectors from
PV for cross-validating the PV and CV models.



 SV: A Switch-level Verifier 





SV will feature the use of 
parametric forms of Boolean expressions 
investigated by us
for incorporating input constraints into
symbolic simulation vectors.
The verification conditions to be established by SV
through symbolic simulation will be derived from 
the very same descriptions provided to the CV tool.



 DB: A Design-requirements Base 





DB will be shared by members of the project group.
The core of DB will be based on the PVS verification
system from SRI. The expressive power of the PVS theory description
language will permit design requirements to be captured at a high level
of abstraction, and also permit future extensions
to exploit PVS's full power. It will also permit the
state transition relation in PV and CV to be translated
into PVS to prove key system properties.
DB will also have facilities to translate assertions in its
design requirements-base into assertions to be verified
by the PV (mainly for protocol) and CV
(mainly for data-layout and cycle-level details)
tools, to ensure consistency
between the models.
A valuable aspect of this organization is that it will permit
regression verification runs after design changes.
The DB tool will have a hypertext-based API allowing designers
to pursue links to various pieces of the specification.



 Benchmark Examples 





Benchmark examples cutting across several hierarchical levels of
abstraction will be released. 
A key verification benchmark-suite delivered will be
a distributed shared memory cache protocol, and its refinement through 
a hardware realization using an industrial bus and a routing network,
the refinement of the bus transactions, the refinement of the bus
arbitration schemes and flow control, all the way down to the bus
interface logic.
