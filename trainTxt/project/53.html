Welcome to the ESL Server






Department of Computer Science

  


Experimental Systems Lab

The Experimental Systems Lab is a facility 
at the

University of Colorado

in the

Department of Computer Science

to support experimental
computer science.

Our facilities are used for general work in
 hardware-software co-design,
 local are area and wide-area networks,
and
 computer architecture .

ESL Features




 
 
Information
on  Fast Ethernet 

 
 Digital Unix 4.0 Manuals 

 
	
	C++ Benchmark Suite
	Some of our hardware-software co-design efforts
	try to optimize statically-typed object-oriented languages.
	We have built a benchmark suite suitable for testing
	new compilers, comparing compilers and understanding
	object-oriented program behavior. 



 
AtomAdvocates
	We make extensive use of ATOM, a program analysis
	and instrumentation tool for DEC Alpha workstations, and
	maintain a FAQ and ``tool shed'' of ATOM-based tools.
 
  	Tools for
	Hardware-Software Co-design
 
  	Inter Operability Tools Survey
