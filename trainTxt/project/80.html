UCB Computer Graphics : OPTICAL








OPtics and Topography Involving the Cornea And Lens


optical@cs.berkeley.edu






Project Overview


Welcome to the home page for the OPTICAL research group.

This project is studying the cornea, the front part of the eye that is
responsible for three quarters of the light refraction in the eye.
Visual correction through contact lenses or recently developed corneal
surgeries require precise information about the shape of the cornea.
Through the use of geometric modeling and scientific visualization,
this project is developing sophisticated techniques to provide
improved shape representations of patients' corneas.

We are affiliated with the Computer Graphics group in the

Computer Science Division at the 
 University of California, Berkeley.
This research is in collaboration with the School of Optometry at Berkeley.


Late-breaking exciting news  

Both of the OPTICAL project's two submissions to SIGGRAPH '96 have been accepted!  They are:



   
      
      
Our SIGGRAPH '96 Electronic Theatre video entitled The OPTICAL Project at UC Berkeley: Computer Aided Cornea Modeling and Visualization.
      
   
   
      
      
Our SIGGRAPH '96 paper entitled Reconstructing Curved Surfaces From Specular Reflection Patterns Using Spline Surface Fitting of Normals.
