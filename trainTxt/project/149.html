UMASS/CS Computer Networks Research Group




 
Computer Networks Research Group 

Department of Computer Science 

University of Massachusetts 

   







The computer networks research group in the 
Computer
Science Department 
at the 
University of Massachusetts at Amherst
is led by Professors 
 Jim Kurose, 
and  Don Towsley. 
Our group's research spans a broad range of topic areas,
addressing both subnetwork and host-related issues,
and represents a complementary mix of both theoretical and
applied experimental research.
Much of the group's work is motivated by emerging
broadband high-speed networks and their 
ability to carry a diverse mix of multimedia traffic.

The groups research divides broadly into four areas:



	Multicasting 

	Parallelized Protocols for Shared Memory Multiprocessors 
	
        Multimedia and Real-Time Communication (currently being updated) 
	
       Modeling and Performance of Communication Networks
