 The Berkeley NOW project 


 






 







The Berkeley Network of Workstations (NOW) project seeks to harness the
power of clustered machines connected via high-speed switched networks. By
leveraging commodity workstations and operating systems, NOW can track
industry performance increases.

The key to NOW is the advent of the killer switch-based and
high-bandwidth network.
This technological evolution allows NOW to support a
variety of disparate workloads, including parallel, sequential, and interactive jobs,
as well as scalable web services, including the world's  fastest web search engine.  
The NOW Project is 
 sponsored  
by a number of 
different contributers.
