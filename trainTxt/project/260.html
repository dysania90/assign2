 The Idea 







 Summary 



The emerging behavioral and active vision paradigms hold that
machines that work in
the real world must be built and tested in the real world, and that
real-world interaction is necessary for perception.
Until recently there has been
no practical alternative to building hardware in
order to test ideas.
Unfortunately,
working with sophisticated physical manipulators or navigators
is an extremely expensive,
time-consuming, and sometimes hazardous process.
Recent advances in simulation
technology in two specific areas have crossed a threshold, enabling
us to solve this problem, and to achieve enormous
speedup in the design of complex, real-world robotic systems.




The first technology is the simulation of sensory interaction with physical
environments (popularly known as virtual reality),
which can replace
the real world in testing and debugging a system.
The second is execution-driven simulation
of complex parallel algorithms
at the level of individual messages and memory accesses,
which can address the performance and
low-level real-time problems of interacting processes.




 With NSF Funding, we are equipping a laboratory that
breaks logically into two halves.
One half of the lab,
the robotics laboratory,
 is for building working systems in the real world.
The other half, the virtual reality laboratory,
is for prototyping and experimentation
in the virtual world.
This hardware and software is configured so that the
computational engines running the robot control algorithms can be
swapped transparently between the real-world devices and the virtual devices.
In addition, the virtual-world lab contains hardware and software
for simulating and analyzing the
control algorithms at a low level,
where all the timings and complexities of
interaction among the various subsystems can be
instrumented and tracked.
