Welcome to the wwweb site
of the Image Processing and Vision Research Group of the Electrical
and Computer Engineering Department at UCSB.




Current research activities include nonlinear image processing
algorithms for image enhancement and restoration, Multisensor Image Registration
and Fusion, Content Based Image Retrieval for GIS and Medical applications,
face recognition, and Visual Learning Algorithms. The laboratory is equipped
with SGI and SUN workstations, IBM-PCs and Macintosh computers. An SGI
machine with realtime video digitization board, a servolens with a CCD
camera, and a pan-tilt camera mount are being used for research in active
vision. Research is primarily supported through funding from NSF, NASA,
ONR, Rockwell, Xerox, Envision, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, Hughes
Communication Systems, Sony, and the UC MICRO program.
