Persistent Linda 
A software system for robust distributed/parallel computing.


WANT TO WRITE TO US?






Objectives
The objectives of the PLinda project are two-fold:

Fault tolerant parallel computing
	    - provide language
   	   constructs that facilitate
   	   the design of high performance fault-tolerant parallel programs.

Harness the aggregate power of idle cycles on networks 
	   of workstations in a manner that is fault-tolerant and does 
	   not disturb the owners of the workstations at all.
	   Our system models non-idleness (e.g. user returns
  	   to workstation) as failure.
	   The work being done at the idle workstation is then moved.


Applications
The major class of PLinda applications are long-running coarse grain parallel applications.



Example applications:

NILE project
Data mining (eg. biological pattern discovery)





Distribution

Source code is available!
And here is how to install it.

Please refer to the PLinda User Manual for 
additional information.
