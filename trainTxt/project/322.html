Introduction



The University of Minnesota-IBM Shared Research Project is a
cooperative research effort in scientific and parallel computing
between the University and IBM.
As part of the 
Shared Research Project program (SUR), IBM has donated 
nine IBM RS/6000s and a fourteen node SP supercomputer.
The University, in turn,
maintains the  hardware and system software, through the 
Department of Computer Science
and the Office of Information Technology, and provides account and user support
through the University of Minnesota Supercomputer Institute,
These computers are housed in the Computer Science Department and are used in a wide range
of scientific computing projects,
ranging from simulating the behavior of the earth's mantle to designing and
implementing software for parallel video-on-demand servers.



The primary source of funding for the SUR Cluster is IBM
in the form of hardware donations through their
Shared University Research
program.  Other sources of funding include the
National Science Foundation through the
Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering,
the University of Minnesota
Supercomputer Institute,
the Office of Information Technology at the University of Minnesota, the
Department of Computer Science
and various University of Minnesota Researchers through the 
Partnership Program.
