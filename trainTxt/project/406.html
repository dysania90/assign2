Physics of Computation
Welcome to Physcmp, Carver Mead's group 
We are part of the Computation and
Neural Systems Program at Caltech.







The Physcmp group works on neuromorphic analog
VLSI, meaning that we build silicon models that mimic, or capture in some
way, the functioning of biological neural systems. We build vision systems,
auditory systems, and systems that learn or adapt. We do a lot of work on
device physics related to learning systems. 



You may be interested in how
we we design our chips,  using Tanner tools and  the Chipmunk
tools, and perhaps also in a possible setup
for chip design using Linux and free tools. You might also be interested
in our lab chip testing setup,
and how we test retina chips.
Our chips are fabricated through the MOSIS service.




Check out our resources.  We are the main
site for distribution of John Lazzaro's Chipmunk
tools. We also have a pretty extensive collection of papers
about analog VLSI. Other resources include all the lab
assignments for Carver's analog VLSI course (CNS 182), and the assignments
for the companion course on Analog VLSI design
(CNS 184). See the full list of resources
for other stuff.



Finally, you might be interested in some random tidbits
of possible interest and links to related sites.
