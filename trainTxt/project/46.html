        Welcome to the CAISR lab at CWRU
      
    
    


      
        The CAISR lab is a leader in the integration of state of the art technology for the purpose of building
        intelligent controls and  automated syatems. CAISR  integrates technologies such as Fuzzy Logic, Expert
        Systems and Neural Networks to create flexible systems. One of our current projects is using chaos
        theory to help diagnose impending failure in rotating machinery. Another is using vision based robotic
        control to create a flexible part feeding system in an automated assembly line. This is just a sample of the
        research that the lab is involved with. Read on for more information about the lab and drop us a line if 
        you have any questions. The address is given below.
      
    
    
      


        
          
            While you are here please be sure to read our lab 
            overview. The overview will provide you with more information about the lab, such as the
            mission and goals of the lab.
          
        
      


      

  
        
          
            The lab is currently involved with many different 
            projects. For more information about the projects you can read through some selected
            abstracts or you can read the papers themselves
            in their respective journals.
          
        
      


      


        
          
            Finally, don't forget to visit the faculty, staff, and
            students at the CAISR facility.
