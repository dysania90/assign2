My broad research area is software engineering, which addresses the
construction of large, complex software systems at reasonable cost and
high reliability.  My research concerns the evolution (e.g.,
enhancement) of large software systems, which is driven by rapid and
unpredictable market forces.  My research in this area often involves
programming tools and the application of new compiler
technology.  I also have interests in parallel systems and
programming language design.  Check out the UCSD Software Evolution Lab's page
for current projects on tool-assisted program restructuring,
visualization of latent program structure, software architecture for
evolving systems, and whole-program analysis techniques for program
understanding and restructuring.
