  Academic Background and Experience
  Undergraduate degree from Concordia College in 1958 in Mathematics and 
Physics.  MA in 1960 and Ph D in 1963 from University of Nebraska.  I 
taught Mathematics for 3 years at the University of Missouri, Columbia.



Since 1966  I have taught mathematics and computer science at Concordia 
College.  My background in abstract algebra has led to my frequent teaching of 
Linear  Algebra and Abstract Algebra as well as the calculus sequence. I 
have also taught Geometry and the Computer Science software applications 
course.
