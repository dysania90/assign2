Welcome to my home page.  You have reached the web address of Dr. Nell B.
Dale, retired Senior Lecturer in Computer Sciences at the University of
Texas at Austin.  I received my Ph.D. in Computer Sciences in 1972 from UT
Austin and have been on the faculty here since 1975. I retired from
full-time teaching in the summer of 1994. I now teach a full load each Fall
and spend the Spring and Summer writing and traveling.




Please feel free to browse in any of my rooms: the resume room, which contains my curriculum vita, the bibliography room, which contains information on the text books I have authored or co-authored, the research room, which contains abstracts of
dissertations that I have co-chaired recently, and the personal room, which
contains mementos of my nontechnical interests.


Please direct any
correspondence to my e-mail account: ndale@cs.utexas.edu.
