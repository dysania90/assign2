UCSD Parallelizing Compiler Group




Compiler technology provides the necessary interface between
programming languages and architectures, and as such is intimately
tied to new developments in both.  Jeanne Ferrante's research focuses
on the development of compiler technology, with particular interest in
exploiting parallelism and optimizing data movement to achieve high
performance.
