corina is  currently in her third year of the graduate program in the   political science here at   u of w       im in my third year in the graduate program at the computer science  department at the university of washington slaving away toward the lofty goal of my phd         i completed his undergraduate degree at the  university of california at san diego  with an odd doublemajor in computer science and political science    im going on leave from graduate school in middecember and im actively looking for a position in software development  if youre interested you can check out my   resume         java applets      webview allows you to see the links to and from a page or set of pages          there are two new additions to the webview family altavistawebview and metawebview  instead of entering a url you enter keywords for altavista or metacrawler and webview hits the search service returning a graph displaying all the pages found by the search services with the links between those pages                     the  automated travel assistant emulates the dialog between a travel agent and client gradually eliciting your flight preferences while allowing you to browse real flight data  its a research prototype but it has quite a bit of functionality even at this early stage         ata  and   webview    have been highly rated by   gamelan and jars    ata  was rated top 1 of java applets by jars whats cool by gamelan and was a gamelan staff pick   webview  was rated top 5 of java applets by jars whats cool by gamelan and was a gamelan staff pick                 and a gamelan staff pick     and   altavistawebview  was one of the winners of the  java repository java contest          my applets have also been published in two books  a walsh foundations of java idg books 1996 le meilleur de java the best of java 1996      heres my first java applet linear ballet        oops  youre not using a javacapable browser  sorry  no cool java applets for you         the source demonstrates using doublebuffering to avoid flicker and using threads to give time to other running applets  the code certainly could be cleaner though so dont expect a work of art here     if you thought that was cool you might have low enough standards to be impressed by my  lgrammer or   particle tree  applets both draw trees  the lgrammer trees look much more realistic than the particletree trees but both are interesting           i recently started a position as a   jars judge evaluating the java applets that are submitted to the  jars archive  very interesting work    in the summer of 1995 i developed dawn of civilization a demonstration application showing that planning techniques can successfully be applied in entertainment software for myriad software      at ucsd

of the headless horseman  chess duel  some assembly required  spheres an image with reflection transparency shadows distributed ray tracing adaptive sampling and a mess of other cool things  the patterns on the spheres are because theyre both transparent and reflective causing the rays to reflect and refract multiple times both from the surface and internally       we also made a 90 second computer animation called the strike  the animation was written using sgi inventor and c code to manipulate the 3d models  the original sgi movie file was 70mb  we have made a  lower quality 275mb quicktime movie  available and a   very low quality 65mb quicktime movie available  sorry it just doesnt compress any further than this at least with anything resembling reasonable quality
