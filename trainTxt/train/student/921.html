page is still under construction                personal information  im a graduate student in the   department of computer science at   yale  university i expect to get a phd in computer science in may 1996 im from   india and moved  to the us in 1988 i hold a bachelors degree in computer science and engineering  from the indian institute of technology bombay and an ms in computer science from the  university of virginia      im married to  rashmi and we have a baby boy     rohan heres some  cool stuff i enjoy                   research      dissertation research  we investigate a novel procedure for the numerical solution of  scalar partial differential equations which are in conservation form  such equations are most commonly  solved on a computer by approximating the derivatives using finite  differences and advancing the solution forward in time using either an  explicit or an implicit method    explicit schemes have the advantage that each time step is very fast  to compute  they are also highly parallelizable however  stability requirements necessitate a very small time step which  increases the total amount of work unacceptably    implicit schemes remove the necessity of taking a very small time  step however each time step is far more expensive in terms of  computer time furthermore the computation process is not easily  parallelizable      in this thesis we propose a new procedure intermediate between the  explicit and implicit schemes described above it results from  modifying the explicit method using the gaussseidel principle we  simply use the latest available information at any point in the  computation process we retain the computational efficiency  of the explicit scheme and at the same time obtain a stability  requirement that imposes an acceptable restriction on the length of  the time step however the truncation error is of a form that again  imposes an unacceptable restriction on the length of the time step we  circumvent this difficulty by using one or more additional sets of  approximations to cancel out the undesirable terms in the truncation  error the new procedure is not as easily parallelized as the explicit  method but is more parallel than the implicit method  hence its  characteristics lie between those of the explicit and implicit methods  we use the new method to solve the 12 and 3 dimensional burgers  equation which is frequently used as a model for the incompressible  navierstokes equations we present proofs of  stability along with experimental results that  validate the theory      details in postscript format these are incomplete drafts im currently  working on        numerical solution of conservation laws 169 k      parallel numerical solution of burgers equation  643 k      time domain parallelism  time dependent pdes are often solved by parallelizing the solution  process in the spatial domain this often limits efficiency as the  number of processors increases in this paper we examine a class  of algorithms which incorporate parallelism in the temporal domain  to increase efficiency we discuss conditions under which these  algorithms may be useful      a postscript version can be found  here 133 k    parallel cfd simulations  a general purpose 3d incompressible navierstokes algorithm is implemented  on a network of workstations using pvm performance comparisons with the  cray ymp and intel ipsc860 are made      a postscript version can be found  here 395 k    efficient parallel programming with linda  we discuss clindas performance in solving a representative scientific  computing problem the shallow water equations and make comparisons with  alternatives available on various shared and distributed memory machines      a postscript version can be found  here 173 k    biological sequence comparison  we describe a general efficient and flexible platform for searching biological  sequence databases that runs on intel hypercubes it can easily be adapted to  evaluate a wide variety of sequence comparison algorithms and shows close to  optimal performance characteristics      i dont have a postscript version                   other technical interests
