research interests focus on the ways in which organizations use  online information oi resources  my pilot research suggests that  oi resources may play an important role in the formation and maintenance  of interorganizational relationships  the main objective  of my current research is to analyze how interorganizational relationships  are mediated through oi resource use  my case study will  describe the social processes of online information mediation by  identifying the roles of intermediaries and the patterns of mediation  which occur when oi resources and other resources such as paperbased media  and personal contacts are used intensively by organizations in the   corporate sector        our cooperating organization on the iris project is knightridder information        guru
