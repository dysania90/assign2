these random syllables brought to you courtesy of     welcome to my web page your personal fully interactive voyage of discovery   now stop wasting time surfing   and go do something to abet commerce or the military        the home page for cse sections ae and ag is  here             thought for the day  computers have been going strictly downhill since   the apple ii series  ah the apple iie now there was a machine  one spent  relatively little time trying to install software apparently written for  a circa 1956 programmable toaster on ones sparc or waiting for the system  administrator to come back from a two to three month lunch      i suppose if youve gone to all the effort of looking at this page then  you are either vaguely interested in me or what im doing or you have  some scant hope of being entertained     ok so a guy walks into a bar with a yak on a leash and the thing is the yak  is huge i mean really big  even for a yak and theyre pretty large to start  with  so the bartender says hey are you planning on bringing that thing in  here  and the guy says first of all its a yak  and second of all im a   freemason so i should certainly hope that im bringing it in here  i forgot  to mention that this is in nottingham or any largish city in the uk that isnt  london  oh and the bar is built on the site of an old pagan temple  aw   forget it                    this is my cat loki     someday i hope to make him supreme ruler of the cosmos  so be kind to animals because someday one of they will have absolute  mastery of time space and the fabric of reality            this is   me on the right fencing sean mcclean   in the 93   junior olympics he won  i knocked him out of the epee tournament the next   day though    you can send me mail    particularly if you wish to say something nice about my cat              im a third year grad student at the u of w cs dept where i study  ai and any other cognitive science disciplines i can get my hands on  im also interested in pure math physicsespecially cosmology and  elementary particle physics paleontology cabbages monarchy whatnot        who am i kidding  i write email read dilbert and drink alot of  mochas dogbert has a place in my personal pantheon  many real  teamplayers have never heard of him yet i make fun of classical  ai a field which makes medieval french theology look like vital  relevant and fastdeveloping  as far as i can tell these days doing  classical ai consists of getting computers to do intelligent things  for which theyre well suited which sane people who are interested in  the same topic find uninteresting and useless  ive heard faculty from  other cs disciplines describe some work as pure ai the connotations  of which ill leave to the agile mind of the reader  feh  pardon me  ill step over to the sink and spit out all my bitterness along with  half of my last drink            sometimes i do research  it is  all in all grad school          an excellent site for studying the   ars magna        my favorite authors are   lord dunsany  stanislaw lem   j l borges  italo calvino  i suppose william gibson haruki  murakami and j r r tolkien also deserve honorable mention  much as i  love these authors not one of them has written the final perfect  book but i think that some of them borges especially have read  fragments of it and allude to half remembered passages in their most  successful writing    if you like childrens books try patricia  maclachlan    also though i cant quite bring myself to put him in  the same class with the aforementioned authors i highly recommend  steven brust agyar and taltos are good places to start          though none of these have their books online many good authors do       i am also a great fan of understated sarcasm       i recommend this excellent story by neil gaiman          chess stuff      other chess stuff        some recommended books      its always fun to reminisce about simons rock a wonderful place although much better in the recollection than in the living  a nice place to wax nostalgic about but you wouldnt want to live there      click here if you would like to  know more about interdisciplinary cognitive science within uw cs       fencing is fun  i am very picky   about the blades i use        i quite enjoy fencing  some bits of it i have down quite well  for instance i have more kime than a battleship full of suicidal klingons on pcp  however as coach jim is often inclined to point out my idea of tactical subtlety  could use broadening       poor jim              an interesting question is that of whether spirit or technique dominates                    much as im inclined to think the sca consists of a bunch of  ferallieurs taking great pleasure in thwacking at each other with sticks   in between  beers historical  fencing is interesting         you can always count on those wacky guys at the fie to come up with some zanymadcap and riotous rule changes    want to see my thrillpacked home page    to be quite honest i dont wander around the web much any more as its almost totally vacuous  oh well maybe things will improve in a few centuries im inclined to doubt it but one might as well be an optimist sigh       i recommend that you look into the poetry of philip larkin if youre having a particularly bad day or if you just want one          in need of a useful web services  nick will take tremendous pleasure in providing them  oh yeah hes also good for a dose of neoluddism  rather odd coming from a cse guy much less an ai flavored one       you might want to check out the electronic muse brought to you by marysuzanne  shes the only person i know  whose cats have home pages      take a gander at  daphnes home page  shescool and has beaucoup attitude          ill leave you with this thanks to messr mehl             when love is gone theres always justice       and when justice is gone theres always force       and when force is gone theres always mom       hi mom             laurie anderson          speak my language                        zmasoncswashingtonedu         ps  hi rane
