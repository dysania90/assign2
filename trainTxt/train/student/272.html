effort to learn about pc multimedia    personal information    academic career here at  georgia tech i am  a phd student in the   college of computings  networking and telecommunications group  my advisor is  mostafa h ammar  i have been at georgia tech since 1988 when i started working on my bs in  in computer science  after graduating in 1992 i started working on my masters 1994 and now my phd  i expect to graduate in may 1997  take a look at my   vita for more information      dissertation work the title of my dissertation is tentatively     network and system support for the efficient scalable delivery of interactive multimedia systems      i may eventually put an html version of my proposal up but if you are really interested in seeing a table of contents or more information send me email kevinccgatechedu  in the meantime i have a   statement of research interests which might be helpful    other areas of interest include learning about multicast protocols used in the mbone the ietf transport and routing working groups and  telecommunications public policy my phd minor     futurenet involvement in addition to my normal teaching and research duties i am working  parttime on   futurenet  this  multimillion dollar effort is being developed with the help of the  georgia center for advanced telecommunications technology gcatt and the  georgia tech office of information technology oit futurenet is basically a next generation network to provide connectivity applications and learning opportunities between middle and high school  students in georgia and various educational institutions like georgia tech fernbank science museum zoo atlanta etc  futurenet requires a great deal of networking infrastructure and this is where i come in  now that the  1996 olympics are over and georgia tech is slowly returning to normal i can now start working on what is officially called the digital  video project of futurenet  this basically involves interconnecting a number of groups at georgia tech  1  students living in the dorms 2 faculty teaching assistants and researchers in academic buildings 3 classes and lectures from classrooms and 4 the rest of the internet applications will be based on realtime audio and video and will require significant bandwidth  to this extent futurenet has been coordinating the installation of the necessary physical network including highspeed lans a analog cable based video system and a digital broadband network for more information see the  digital video  project home page      current goals  as of september 1 1996 i have about 9 months to graduation  my plan is to spend the next six months working on my current research projects and the final three months writing and finalizing my dissertation  the three most significant projects im working on now are  1  development of the interactive multimedia jukebox 2 video delivery at georgia tech and 3 continued work on the mlisten collection tool    also in the next 9 months ill be looking and interviewing for a postgraduation job       publications talks and demos    journal papers  k almeroth and m ammar   on the use of multicast delivery to provide a
