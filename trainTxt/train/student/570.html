      one out of five animals on this planet is a beetle   and thats a fact        this thing is under construction   deal with it             email            snadcsmcgillca           if you are already bored and want out you can return to  abrahams homepage  if thats from whence you came  thats the undegraduate physics page in case you didnt come from there  i used to be in physics so i get to be linked from thence      if you came from  socs  mcgill university school of computer science whence i now live you may return there also  i wont keep you      if you want to go somewhere other than there there are links coming up  if notwell i cant do much about that      the history of my homepgae      i was the first physics undergrad to get a homepage  it really wasnt my idea to get one it was made for me against my will  but now that ive deleted the original stupid one that my friends designed for me and rewrote the whole thing its okay  i guess        i am no longer in physics actually  i somehow managed to graduate this year  im not quite sure how i managed that but i did  now i am just another overeducated unemployed member of genx doing a masters so i dont have to face the real world anytime soon fortunately though i have elected to stay far away from physics for the time being and continue my education in cs computer science i just dont like typing it all out      actually im not even doing a masters  im way low on the totem pole of grad studies  im a qualifying student cant you hear the loud booming baritone male echo voice saying that  what that means is that i get to share an office get to use the graduate lounge but have to take undergrad classes to make up for the fact that i didnt take any when i was an undergrad      so far cs is okay although im not used to being productive        my liberal slant     hopefully i will soon put my own little mediocre ideas here like how i think the walt disney corporation and microsoft are both evil and i should also write what i  mean  by evil       for now though you should check out this web site    the reactionary right      although its about the us and i live in canada the us is so powerful that its policies somehow affect policies in canada  i still believe though that canada still has enough backbone not to follow the us blindly  also canada seems to be heading toward a conservative trend  the popularity of the reform party and the introduction of workfare in ontario are just an example        even if you are a staunch conservative i suggest you check out the site  for two reasons  first i think it is always good to hear another persons point of view even if you disagree with it  and even if you still disagree after you have heard the other side of the story maybe at least you will gain understanding  personally i dont really believe that any side is completely right or wrong  i think no one will ever know either   second it always helps to know what your enemies are saying about you          heres another web site you may enjoy   the written word  a political journal      although most of the stuff in the journal is pretty leftist or centerist whatever its pretty fair anyways  fairer than most of the media anyways       something puzzling   now why oh why is it that when i do a search for evolution all i get is links to sites which are antievolution ie creationists  where are the evolutionists  in my opinion this is getting a little unhealthy here there seems to be a prevalence of only one opinion now the question is are most people creationists or are most people evolutionists but are a silent majority who feel extremely secure about their point of view  or are the creationists just a very vocal group who are trying to sway people to their side  food for thought either way the lack of several points of view is unhealthy how can you get understanding without discussion          mind you i finally did find something    misconceptions about evolution    its actually part of a larger broader debate of creationism vs evolutionism   evolution vs creationism homepage        stupid stuff     if you want a little insanity try this out for size  its the plight of somebody on the web who got messed up with copyrights and stuff something similar happened about a year ago where some guy almost got sued by disney for having their pictures on his homepage but i cant seem to find him anymore    anyway this is a problem with dilbert    i think that this prettymuch serves as justification for my position that large corporations should not be allowed on the web  nor should anybody who doesnt have a clue       heres my menial contribution to the party    i went to this high school in the north end where several weird things happened most of them will hopefully someday become urban legends  id really like that cuz some of these are just too much  and i swear theyre true      and heres another contribution   i had this friend whos page when it was still available  was decidedly less serious than mine could ever be and had this cool  jungian temperment sorter  which told me im  enfj        my icon sources      s polifroni october 7 1996
