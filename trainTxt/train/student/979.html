1st year graduate student at tulane university    i just received my double major in computer science  and mathematics and  plan to receive a masters degree in computer science  in may of 97 my main area of interest and expertise is pc software  im particularly interested pc operating systems mass market desktop applications and   development tools i try to follow industry news closely and  enjoy discussing the weeks news with knowledgeable people my  main hobby outside of school is tweaking and upgrading my computer  at home after a few years of upgrading i finally have my dream  machine assembled if youre interested you can check out the specs      when i graduate i would like to work for a major software house  developing software for windows ntwindows 9597 i want to  work at least a few years with a small team of super programmers  in a dungeon with ragged tshirts sipping coke wearing puffy  bearclaw slippers with my feet up on a desk and working 100 hour  weeks just to get our software out on time after that i would  like to move up the ladder to project manager and oversee the  development of a major product from start to finish and be proud  that i was an integral part in its success thats my dream        there are basically two things that i dislike in the computer  industry macs and os2  i am the first to admit that i am very opinionated i have found  that both macintosh and os2 advocates os2 people more so tend  to be very vocal in the defense of their platform if you like  debating or would just like to send me your opinion on why someone  should use os2 or a macintosh instead of windows 95nt fill  out my os 2 amp macintosh form  and click send or                     where do you want to go today            anyone who knows me knows how much i admire microsoft i am a  complete microsoft junkie and proud of it follow a few links  and maybe youll see the light too                visit bill gates  and co and catch up on the future of computing at the microsoft home page  microsoft updates their server about once a week and overhauls  the look of things about once every 2 months or so at about 2 million hitsday it really  is one of the best sites on the web for both general and technical  product information      i have given up using netscape  in my opinion i know i have a lot of them ie3 kills netscape  i never   liked downloading 78 betas anyway  if ie3 is a superset of navigator why use netscape  ie4 will make   this whole netscape vs microsoft fight moot  netscape will have to fight to hold its markets in unix   os2 ha and the new handheld web market netscape wants to create  ie3 dominance in winodws and mac   lets seethats about 95 of the total market is just a matter of time for microsoft      check out this document about microsoft corporation for  a little background information on a great company       want the latest on windows 95      i always try to support microsoft in any way i can i have been  studying windows 95 for about three years now ive been using it  since march 23 1995 so if you have any questions regarding  windows 95 please dont hesitate to ask  windows 95 is an outstanding product has easily lived up to the  hype windows 95 has by any measure changed the shape of the entire industry  and introduce new innovations such as mpeg and 3d to the masses  although not quite as uncrashable as windows nt windows 95 is  a quantum leap above windows 3xx so if you are thinking about  buying os2 think again ask yourself who is developing for warp  and who is developing for windows 95 every single major pc software  publisher has been porting their apps to windows 95 over the past  twothree years os2 warp has one or two big guys that have win95 and warp  plans why switch to os2 i cant see why       its too bad ibm cant do anything significant with os2 windows  95 has no real competition now an argument could be made for  os2 over windows 3xx but windows 95 eliminates all of os2s  advantages over 16 bit windows dont be fooled by the very vocal  os2 crowd windows 95 is a great product that destroyed any  need for os2 warp except for that cult of os2 internet buffs  that think microsoft is the root of all evil if you doubt me  check out some of the flaming os war messages on composos2advocacy or  the canopus forum on compuserve and see for yourself         other microsoft

basic  should have been it is an extremely easy to use powerful rad  environment what really differentiates it from visual basic and  powerbuilder is that is is completely objectoriented based on  object pascal and compiled not interpreted this means  it is very easy to compile and distribute without worrying about  distributing runtime dlls there is also a significant speed advantage  of compiled programs over interpreted ones ive written several  delphi applications and i am still amazed at the power and ease  of use delphi offers i have been using delphi exclusively for my development   of applications at work and i love it          music                check out the home pages of some of my favorite bands      metallica  nine inch nails  alice in chains  slayer

cough up 50 at netscape     up until a few months ago netscape was leading the way in the support of new html 30 features  such as page backgrounds tables and floating images  then all of a sudden microsoft internet   explorer 20 came on the scene  with support for inline video watermarks background sounds and more   microsoft challenged netscape for the leadership position in web browsing  netscape was still ahead of microsoft  in some areas such as frames and plugins but when internet explorer 30   came out microsoft finally matched or surpassed netscape in every category  now ie3 is a superset of navigator   in every way except multiplatform support  so what if the 5 of non windowsmac machines out there dont run ie                got a math question can you trust your processor ask
