     compilers program optimization and data dependence testing in the presence   of dynamic pointerbased data structures           long description         data structures are important solution components in many programs since  the proper choice of data structure can greatly impact the efficiency of  the resulting application  this is wellknown to fortran programmers where  arrays serve as the primary data structure  recently however given the  increasing use of languages such as ada c c and fortran 90 data  structures built using pointers and dynamic memory allocation are more  prevalent  these types of structures  linkedlists trees dags  present  new and difficult analysis and optimization problems for the compiler  writer  the objective of our work is to solve these problems thereby  enabling the parallelization of such codes        our approach is to create a data dependence testing framework targeted  towards program code involving dynamic pointerbased data structures  our  framework has three components 1 property collection 2 path collection  and 3 dependence testing  to enable accurate dependence testing the  compiler must collect both information about the properties of the data  structure eg tree vs dag and information about the memory locations  being manipulated in the data structure  the former are represented as  axioms about the structure the latter as paths through the structure  given this information the dependence testing component applies   theorem proving in a general and decidable way to determine dependences  in the code          to date we have implemented a prototype of our data dependence testing  framework and successfully parallelized a number of important codes  involving complex data structures  these codes include the nbody problem  sparse matrices and a 3d electromagnetic simulation based on bipartite  graphs  speedups were linear to nearlinear on a sharedmemory  multiprocessor        our work is crucial to optimizing and parallelizing compilers since  dependence information directly impacts the application of numerous  performanceenhancing transformations  the more accurate the dependence  information the more chances for optimization and parallelization  at all levels from lowlevel instruction scheduling to sourcelevel  loop transformations  our work represents the first accurate and
