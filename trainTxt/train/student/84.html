systems   worked with a multiagent design system called team for creating steam condenser designs extended the team system to enable learning organizational knowledge also worked with a simulator called taems for modeling and studying coordination issues in multiagent system extended this system to enable it to learn coordination in addition conceived designed and built a system for distributed casebased reasoning common lispclos       networked information gathering    worked on a team building an agentbased networked information gathering system was resposible for the planner component and the integration of all the system components common lispc       machine learning systems    built a number of machine learning systems in both lisp and c programmed id3 ibl and cbr systems wrote code for genetic algorithms and designed and built a flexible neural networks simulator in c lisp c       pattern recognition systems    project leader for a team that built a handwritten numerals recognition system for automated bank check processing was actively involved in building various components in addition to managing the team       information retrieval    built a complete ir system as a part of information retrieval course the system creates inverted indices retrieves and ranks documents and displays them to the user c       expert systems    built an expert system for psychiatric evaluation using the vp expert shell 200 rules      information extraction and natural language processing   built a small ie system for the terrorist events domain using methods for statistical nlp for information extraction       compilers amp os    implemented a complete twopass compiler for a considerable subset of modula to generate assembly code for mips r3000 architecture this includes developing a scanner parser semantic processing and assembly language code generation  also wrote code for device drivers and a shell          journal articles and and
