rimbo             updated last 112196       i fear the denver  broncos      more appropriately i fear john  elway         well well wellhow about those longhorns it would appear that mackovic  formerly known as the iceman has stepped up and decided to  lead the team with a little bit of emotion maybe we do have a chance to  get slaughtered by either colorado or nebraska in the big 12 championship      there are three sections to this page my undergraduate thesis  a few sound modules ive written and a list of links  through which i can share some of my interests              my undergraduate thesis      a knowledgebased approach for generating transitions between  musical themes by computer in real time or something like that        basically its an attempt to take two musical themes and have the  computer generate a musical transition between them       im fortunate that i had the chance to make all my mistakes in undergraduate  schooli think ill get my chance to do a thesis correctly now that im  a phd student at ucsd there are a few major flaws with this and i think  i ought to let yall know what they are before you dive in and download  these two files       the paper is almost totally lacking proper research honestly i tried  to find similar works but could not find them on the other hand i could  have looked harder for books on chord theory and come up with a good generalized  list of rules instead of the ones i invented in the last minute     also along with the lack of research the paper has a very poorly  designed related works section i had very little idea what  was expected of me because i put this part off until the last nanosecond      the two parts above give the paper sort of a lone ranger  type of feel which was not my intention at all in fact i owe quite a  lot to the renaissance guys tran and daredevil for making the pmodew  header the executable uses and to mikmak of hardcode for the mikmod routines  i used     finally as youll probably read i only got 23 of the way done theres  simply no excuse for that        so anyway here it is   a zipped postscript  version of the actual paper   source  code sample song and dos executable zipped   the source code compiles just fine with pmodew and watcom cc 106  given the included makefile the executable requires the sample song to  be in the same directory with it and also requires a soundcard most soundcards  workall soundcards that mikmod supports this supports including the  gravis ultrasound soundblaster 16 and a half dozen others         my tracked music      here are some songs ive done in close to the order i did themall  are in either s3m or xm format      if you dont already have a player for these download cubic  player if you normally use dos mod4win  shareware if you use windows 95 or if you happen to be a linux user  i recommend mikmod  209b      i am in considerable  pain funk my first tracked tune ever put me in the ranks  of the notsoelite animaniacs trackers club along with luv  kohli and raymond singing wolf or kitsune or raymond blackwolf or whatever  name hes going by nowadays     three minutes  past midnight industrial ahhh such a marvelous waste of channels  this has some of the better samples of the lot i still like it even after  all of these years     the bird the  fountain and the temple demomusic this was originally an  fm s3m but i converted it to an xm it sounded better as an fm tunetragically  i lost the original     seizure  industrial my first phluid release i still am not too fond of  this one but there are a shockingly great number of people who really  love this song you decide     pain ii  dance the song accused of sounding like my sharona  it was actually inspired by gimme some lovin by steve winwoods  old band i forget their name     quartet  classical a chiptune i like the oboe patch for the gusyou get  12 samples for the price of 9k     chiptune  chip got second place in one of the original 20minute chiptune  compos     the bells  of zhakanh ambientpop this is the first song ive tracked  to come close to the quality of my midi work some people dont like the  dissonant harmonies in this one i think this one rocks all of the rest  personally     insanity  industrialartmusic this song was the last song i released on  a phluid music pack i didnt like it at first because it was hastily  completed however im beginning to realize that it takes my music in  a direction id really like to go when listening to it imagine someone  who has flipped out going from mood to mood to unsanitary mood     3 themes  no style the example song from my thesis but with transitions  written by me designed for scientific reasons not aesthetics hornet  gave this song a rating of  which is their way of saying why did  you even bother    hyperactif  danceacid a reworked version of my naid multichannel music competition  entry its a lot better now than what i released to the compo it still  sucks        the three songs which most people seem to like of these are seizure  pain ii and insanity if youre limited in time and space you probably  cant go very wrong with those three my personal favorite is the bells  of zhakanh      and more stuff to come   a few favrite links   the lurkers  guide to babylon 5   what babylon 5 why should i watch babylon 5 isnt  it just a star trek ripoff no and heres why its a fiveyear  story with rich detail fortunately for those of us who are truly  addicted the show wont be over after five yearsthere will be a spinoff  series carried by tnt   the trax homepage trax can be  found on the server ircdemosceneorg   the ensoniq vfx home  page   the ultimate longhorn site for  people like me who are homesick longhorns             to contact me write to
