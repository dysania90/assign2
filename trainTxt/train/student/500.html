kerberos is an distributed authentication service used in a client  server environment where a trusted thirdparty service is used to verify the  identities of users or clients  the kerberos authentication model is based  in part on the needham and schroeder key distribution protocol with the  addition of timestamps  it uses the data encryption standard in cipher  block chaining mode  kerberos was implemented at project athena at mit in  1986  the latest version of mit kerberos is version 5 beta 7  specifications can be found in rfc 1510  in greek mythology kerberos is the
