charity      all stranded sailors knew that they could always go to joe beefs      and in exchange for chopping a few chords of firewood      get a meal and a warm place to sleep      joe printed the above manifesto on handbills and advertisements          computer architect and os hacker    although i was an aspiring computer architect something i formerly  had on my fake motorola business card ever since i started working with computers   the first thing i did on learning z80 assembly was redesign the chip    i started out as a unix kernel hacker gould realtime unix and  still think of myself wistfully as an os hacker              i have a beard  i frequently wear suspenders  i am not balding            computer architecture    once and future    i was involved in the microarchitecture of the intel pentium pro p6  and in the adoption of mmx by intel see my resume        wannabe author the art of computer architecture        i am constantly on the verge of writing a book entitled   the art of computer architecture   a grabbag of tricks and techniques   sort of an antidote to hennessy and patterson   but i cannot afford the diskspace on an internet service provider  or the charges for an always connected system of my own   suggestions appreciated      interesting pieces of computer architecture    one of the best ways to  learn how to be a computer architecture is to read   not textbooks but datasheets     instruction set references     etc                    miscellaneous info            web wanderings    netscape    bookmarks          stocks            coding standards  roy wilkinsons  p6 c coding standards    i disagree with many of these                    rcs and configuration management            although or perhaps because i quit my first real job   at a quickly defunct startup company called enfoprise   building business workstations  on the first day   because they had changed my job assignment   from unix driver writing  to systems integration  i have had a longstanding lovehate relationship with configuration  management tools like sccs and rcs        my first published paper was  boxes links and parallel trees elements of a configuration management system  in the first usenix workshop on software management  in this i described a centralized rcs database  with multiple views and hardlink cloning to save space and time  as used by gould computer systems divisions unix team        brian berliner deprecates my approach in one of the cvs papers  mainly because he advocates an optimistic concurrency control approach  whereas he thought that i advocated locking  actually i advocate optimistic concurrency control  but i also advocate locking in case the optimistic version   gets into livelock  and i usually insist that there be a single identified serial schedule   of source code checkins  so that testing can proceed in a linear manner  i require programmers to test that their new code works   in a system with all previous fixes applied  although i recognize that even this requirement can be relaxed        i often use a more stripped down version of the same approach  in things like the     p6 eas    i apologize for never having created a truly portable set of tools to accomplish this        p6 uses a similar approach  although mike fetterman and mark aitken deserve the credit here        for p6 i enhanced rcs 55 with several features that went into rcs 56  most notably the r version number which became r in rcs 56        and overall i am sufficiently a fan of rcs that i rcs everything  including my cshrc login and even my web page                        calendar          wisconsin  how to arrange meetings with me etc      since there seems to be no ubiquitous calendaring or scheduling program  at the university of wisconsin cs department  various people use   suns cmtool or the public domain ical or plan but there is not a critical mass of any  of these  i am now doing my calendaring in isolation using the pilot pda and its associated pc software  at least this means i can add meetings on the fly  when it gets into my pilot the meeting is committed  or at least as committed as is possible      i may also record meetings on the fly using my voice organizer        therefore to arrange a meeting with me you must get in touch with me  preferably by email possibly by phone or in person so that i can manually  add the meeting to my calendar         i have not yet created a way to download my calendar from the pilot software  to a web page         i have not yet created a way to download my calendar from the pilot software  to my microsoft watch        intel  at intel i was a devout user of the group scheduling program   last time i was at intel synchronize unixpc but also ontime in the past   which were weak in that they did not have disconnected operation or email operation  but at least allowed the majority of people in md6 and mrl to schedule meetings  with me without my manual intervention  at intel the scheduling algorithm was   if you have access to andys calendar using synchronize use it  but also tell andy what the meeting is about by email or in person  i reserve  the right not to go to meetings to which i have been blindly invited  if you cannot use synchronize if urgent make the meeting      with andys admin teresa locke who can put it in synchronize  if possible check out andys calendar on his web page      and propose  if the meeting is not urgent eg is two or more weeks in the future      you can avoid bothering teresa      by sending andy email  but realize that andy may miss the meeting if you have not sent the      email far enough in advance    overall  scheduling and calendaring and other pim and pdalike topics  are something that i am fascinated with    how do we bring the efficiency advantages of having personal secretaries  and aides de camp to all computer users        header
