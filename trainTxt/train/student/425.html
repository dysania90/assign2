cummington street mcs211  tel 401 7815137  dgdcsbuedu                   im a graduate student in computer science at boston university  working on collaborative editing im more interested in text and  hypertext than multimedia and hypermedia and im most interested in how  people can collaborate by using and editing shared hypertexts     on my practical  side im interested in multiuser collaboration on shared documents  on real networks that is to say unreliable regularlydisconnected  networks the experience of writing a book with a coauthor has added  a firsthand depth to what were originally theoreticallymotivated  beliefs       on my radical side inspired to a great degree by ted  nelson im interested in shared writing spaces where free writing and  rewriting of evrything can take place with a careful trail of what  has happened as insurance against misrepresentation      fortunately for both sides of my professional personality the same  kind of technology is required to solve both problems  realtime  collaboration is something that i think is very important but its  not one of my current areas of activity      im also an sgml or at least contentmarkup bigot      this page contains descriptions of my work on versioning and  markup youll have to find some other way to scope out my hobbies and  favorite links    davids research    versioning     im working on a model i call palimpsest after the overwritten  scroll from which scholars extract previous versions of  texts palimpsest is a general data model that provides very  finelevel control of version management states and policies it makes  an explicit architectural assumption that a version management system  is controlling data and not processes for accessing data this  approach allows finer control at the cost of greater application  overhead       the palimpsest paper was presented at the workshop on  collaborative editing systems at cscw 94  it is the most uptodate  documentation of my most general work on version control ive done a  partial html conversion of this  paper this converted version is complete except that it is still  missing the first 2 illustrations if youd prefer a fully formatted  version download the file at the end of this link to get compressed postscript  of the palimpsest paper        fabio vitali and i have written a paper  proposing a system of version  management for the world wide web this is designed as a relatively easy  to implement method to bring artifactbased collaboration to the www by  supporting independent editing via version control over the web the  recent announcement of widespread availability of javabased web browsers  makes implementation of crossplatform clientside editors seem much more  feasible this paper will was presented at the fourth world wide web  conference in december 1995       ive recently written a little screed on versioning and the www for  the versioning working  group run by jim whitehead at  the university of california      with fabio vitali and the others in the group ive been working on a draft  of functional requirements for versioning on the web  markup     content markup is technique for describing texts  for future processing the current baseline for all content markup  systems is sgml iso standard 8879 however there are many questions  about markup that are unanswered and perhaps unanswerable for  instance for all the talk of sgml being semantically based there is  no good description of what it means to mark up a document there are  also  interesting  problems with handling nonhierarchical markup in sgml as well as  good arguments that nonhierarchical structures are important in texts      ive been following up the work on nonhierarchical markup with elli  mylonas and steven derose in a paper abstract accepted at the 1996 achallc annual conference in  bergen this abstract describes some advanced directions for  describing the structure of the kinds of complex texts and textual  theories that come up in humanistic research    the text encoding initiative has a variety of lessons to offer to the  html effort in a paper to appear at the fourth www conference four  fellow tei alumni and i offer some  lessons for  the world wide web from the text encoding initiative  versioning working group     the versioning working group is a group of currently four people  who are all concerned with the problems of version management in  hypertext systems currently we are working on a paper a sort of  union framework of the strategies for version and change management of  which we are aware we held a   workshop at echt 94 which we hope will  help to expand and solidify the hypertext version management  community    recently we held another workshop at ecscw 95 whose proceeedings  are not yet available    another interesting workshop was the workshop on collaborative  editing systems held as cscw 94       hytime     steven derose and i have written a book on the hytime standard which describes  an sgmlbased hypermedia interchange language       more on making hypermedia work a users  guide to hytime    hytime ongoing review      steven derose and i have also prepared some input to the ongoing  hytime review process  a technical corrigendum has been accepted at  ballot but the final wording of the upcoming changes has not yet been  determined    steve and i have had a number of discussions of  changes that might be made and ive prepared a document discussing our proposed changes most  changes proposed in this document have been accepted in principle  ie some things have been changed but in a different way from what  we suggested a few were rejected our annex c comments mostly and  some others deferred for more careful consideration        this is my daughter despina               last updated 6596
