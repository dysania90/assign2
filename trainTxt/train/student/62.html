i am a phd candidate at the  computer science department of the  courant institute of   mathematical sciences  of new york university    i received a bs in computer science from   suny stony brook in 1993 and  an ms in computer science from nyu in 1995  i grew up in new york city and attended  the day school  city and country and finally trinity             research interests  i am interested in the theoretical and practical ways to address  faulttolerant computing where  response time is critical        the main area of my research is in litetransactions  which have some of the properties of transactions but are  very light weight  traditional transactions have properties acid which are  useful for faulttolerance but traditional transactions are too expensive  to be practical in many areas  previous  lightweight  transactions eg group commit  have addressed increased  server throughput  however the increased throughput has been  achieved at the expense of increased client response time  in many  situations such as in realtime systems this tradeoff is not  desirable or even practical  unlike traditional transactions  litetransactions do not commit to disk  rather they commit to  memory this makes them very light allows them to provide  temporal guarantees that traditional systems cant and  makes them applicable when response time guarantees are needed      if a servers fails  committed litetransactions may be lost in this case the system is  recovered from the last checkpoint    due to their volatile nature litetransactions pose a challenge  for low overhead nonclient blocking distributed checkpointing  i have developed an efficient checkpointing algorithm for   litetransactions which is nonblocking for clients and requires  very little synchronization for servers        we have applied litetransactions to the linda model  linda may be  used to harness the aggregate power of networks of workstations  however linda is not faulttolerant and linda  processes can become obtrusive when a user finds her  machine busy with someone elses processes and the piranha system  can only be used for a limited types of applications         we have a working prototype of a system called   persistent linda  where  we apply litetransactions to the linda model  persistent linda may  be used to harness the aggregate power of networks of workstations in  an unobtrusive manner processes are automatically killed ie kill 9 pid  on one machine and restarted elsewhere the faulttolerance  mechanisms built on litetransactions allow processes to recover from  their last commit point  in fact the type architecture of the  originating machine and the final destination machine can be  different    he fact that processes can be migrated independently  is crucial to utilizing networks of workstations for parallel  applications      i have worked extensively on the current version of the prototype  which is approximately 20000 lines of c  this includes designing and implementing no overhead locking for degree 2 litetransactions  designing and implementing buffered writes and piggybacked transactions operations   reimplementing the tuple data structure for more efficiency and portability  and reimplementing the communication library for portability          another project i am working on  is to provide transparent shared memory fault tolerance and a runtime  system capable of running efficiently on highly unpredictable networks  eg the www  for java  with this type of language and runtime system programmers have a rich  environment to write
