    dean jerding         dean jerding is a phd student in the graphics visualization and usability center of the college of  computing at georgia tech           notice  graduating seeking employment    i plan to be graduating with my phd in the spring of 1997  i have begun my job search and am interested in a position in the software industry       seeking a company with which i can apply technical expertise management knowledge and leadership skills in an innovative technology and product development environment driven by identified or expected customer needs       resume postscript          academic background    dean graduated from the university of virginia in 1992 with a degree in  electrical engineering  he then entered the computer science phd program here at georgia tech in the fall of 1992  along the way toward his phd dean received his ms in computer science in 1996  dean has passed his qualifying exams and has proposed a thesis topic       visualizing patterns of interaction in the execution of objectoriented programs       the dynamic behavior of objectoriented programs is difficult to  design implement and modify  understanding the interactions between  classes and objects is necessary to create efficient designs and make  safe modifications  this thesis work seeks to identify visualize and  analyze recurring patterns of interaction in objectoriented program  executions as a means for understanding and examining dynamic  behavior  support is directed toward design recovery validation and   reengineering tasks such as comparing existing design or mental model    specifications with designlevel specifications reverse engineered from the   implementation       dean spent the summer of 1995 as an intern in the software production research department of formerly atampts bell laboratories in naperville il and is currently doing parttime consulting for scientificatlanta inc  dean hopes to graduate in march 1997 and is looking forward to taking a job in industry no more of this academic amp           research interests    dean is a member of the software visualization research group  specifically he is focused on visualizing objectoriented software  his other interests include information visualization objectoriented software engineering userinterface design and human computer interaction  below are some highlights of deans research      visualizing objectoriented software    the objectoriented approach to program design has made a significant  impact on the way software is developed and maintained  programmers  have adopted the objectoriented approach in order to take advantage  of better data abstraction and encapsulation reuse through inheritance and  polymorphism        this work seeks to help software developers testers and maintainers understand the dynamics of objectoriented systems  while many oo design techniques begin with static object modeling it is the dynamics of the object interactions that are most important to how a program operates  of course these interactions are the most difficult part of the system to design and understand  additionally these aspects of a system are often less documented than their more static counterparts  my approach is to use visualization to convey information to programmers about their systems that is not available through static analysis and dynamic profiling        the key to my approach is the use of patterns of interaction between entities in the system as abstractions which bridge the gulf of abstraction between a programs design and its implementation  the first step in the process is to gather static information about a system and then generate trace files which record system behavior  by analyzing the behavior patterns of interaction can be uncovered  using various filtering and abstraction techniques the highlevel behavior can be extracted from the lowlevel patterns  graphical visualizations are used to present this information to programmers and allow them to control the filtering and abstraction process  the abstract behavior can then be compared with design level information such as execution scenarios dynamic state models or architectural models  the support is thus directed toward design recovery and validation tasks       the technical report visualizing message patterns in objectoriented program executions describes our initial efforts to extract and visualize patterns of messages in oo systems         history       in late 1993 dean built the first prototype view for visualizing the execution of c programs  it is based on work done in the groove system and contains a simple view of the inheritance hierarchy and message passing in an executing program      the second generation prototype supports multiple views of a program and its execution  a technical report is available describing this framework using visualization to foster objectoriented program understanding

understanding graphics visualization and usability center georgia institute of technology atlanta ga technical report gitgvu9433 july 1994             visualizing large information spaces    information visualizations must allow users to browse information  spaces and focus quickly on items of interest  navigational  techniques which utilize some representation of the entire information  space provide context to support more detailed information views  however the limited number of pixels on the screen makes it difficult  to completely display large information spaces  the information  mural is a twodimensional reduced representation of an entire  information space that fits entirely within a display window or  screen  the mural creates a miniature version of the information  space using visual attributes such as grayscale shading intensity  color and pixel size along with antialiased compression techniques  information murals can be used as standalone visualizations or in  global navigational views         this technique evolved from research in visualizing the execution of large objectoriented programs see above  information murals of various information including text files stock market data sunspot data river flow data and geographic site locations have been created        see the technical report below for details  a draft of the report is available online
