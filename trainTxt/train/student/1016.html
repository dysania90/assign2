the architecture and performance analysis   of data traffic over atm networks he has been with the     network research group  led by    prof tatsuya suda  since 1990 he has published a number of papers on connectionless  servers for atm and atm congestion control         education           currently pursuing phd in information and computer science at    the university of california irvine      thesis work is progressing    in two stages  the first stage design of a connectionless server    for transmitting connectionless datagrams over the connection oriented    asynchronous transfer mode atm network and performance analysis     through simulations and analysis is nearly complete having resulted    in a paper currently in submission  the second stage an exploration    of the potential fractal nature of atm traffic is currently in progress    completion is expected in 1997          ms information and computer science     university of california irvine june 1993      investigated
