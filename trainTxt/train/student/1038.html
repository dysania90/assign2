what my advisor may tell you  i dont actually have much free time   but i have been known to       dance israeli folk dances favorite dance  shorashim  i dont go regularly any longer but if you are interested  in giving it a try let me know  i still enjoy going from  time to time      jump out of airplanes  ive only done this twice but i am  totally hooked  as soon as i scrape up the time and money  im going again  anyone interested in joining me  i can  get you 10 off       hurtle down mountainsides  skiing is a recent  hobby for me  once i discovered the homomorphism that mapped my  childhood sport of ice hockey to skiing i was off just imagine  playing ice hockey with really long skates on an inclined surface   everything else is the same especially if you get in my way gt      ride a bike  my wife and i are working up to our first century  100 mile trip from newport beach to san diego       read  my favorite authors are toni morrison   especially her books song of soloman and beloved   and don delillo especially the names and ratners star      dabble in foreign languages  right now i just  try to reacquire whatever limited foreign language abilities i ever had  languages that i forget more and more of on a daily basis are  hebrew i can still speak read and write but not very well  spanish cant speak or write but for some strange reason i can  understand a lot and japanese i just nod knowingly      web links       some other researchers in programming languages and compilers     computing research association     glimpse a bibliographic search engine
