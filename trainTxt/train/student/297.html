        background  scott mccrickard is a phd student in the   college of computing   at the  georgia institute of technology  he is a member of the  software  visualization group in the  graphics visualization  and usability center at tech  his advisor is    john stasko  the focus of scotts research is on  internet information monitoring and display          scott received his undergraduate degree from the  university of north carolina at chapel hill  in 1992  his major was mathematical sciences with an  emphasis in computer science  for his honors project he helped design  and implement pgoms  an interface for creating goms models          scott has worked at  oak ridge national laboratories ornl  with tom rowan as a member  of the visual and  information sciences group  while at ornl scott built the first  version of irwin  an information resource monitoring and display tool  as part of the  gonii  collaborative tools project          if you are interested please examine scotts    resume            research  the focus of scotts research is the area of information visualization  he has also done work in parallel and distributed computing  below are listed some research areas of interest  if you wish to  discuss any of these topics  please get in touch with scott            internet information monitoring and display   is an important area considering the constantly growing  and changing nature of the internet  resources such as email usenet  news and the world wide web provide a continuous flow of information  while users can access this information using any of a number of readers  and browsers it is difficult to determine when and if a resource  needs to be accessed  in addition the large amounts of information  that accumulate can be difficult to assimilate at a glance          visualizations are needed that will provide an overview of these resources  with a detailed look at recent changes  as a result information about  the names and content of the messages and documents must be encoded in  a small number of pixels through the use of color intensity size  and shape  these techniques are reflected in  irwin a tool that  monitors resources and provides various alerts  when changes occur  a multilayer view of the resources  simultaneously provides a broad overview of all resources plus  a narrow look at recent changes without losing context          recently scott was also part of a team that developed  sqwid a java tool for visualizing  the results from an alta vista search  sqwid provides  a stressbased graph view of the search result sites  that will hopefully help users identify  interesting web sites          program visualization examines methods for visualizing  information about a computer program  for years programmers have drawn  pictures such as flowcharts or controlflow diagrams to help other  programmers and users better understand their programs  unfortunately these pictures will not provide the  exact desired perspective for every user  clearly methods are needed for automatically generating  graphical representations of programs          existing code formatters profilers and analysis systems provide  adequate static and postmortem views of a program  however  debugging and understanding is aided if the program execution  is shown in conjunction with the program code  by visually connecting  the code and execution the user can identify elements in the program  that otherwise would not be visible  scott is working on runview  a runtimebased code analysis system  that incorporates these and other ideas  he is also exploring how  runview can be used to decompose software architectures in a project  with gregory abowd          software visualization is the use of graphics  visualization and animation as an aid in the understanding of  algorithms architectures and software  software visualizations  can be constructed using toolkits like  tango  and polka  with these toolkits a programmer creates objects and programs them  with actions that occur over a number of frames          with the advent of improved hardware the number of frames displayed  per second is sure to decrease  thus a natural evolution is to specify  actions not in frames but in real time seconds and milliseconds  this concept is central to polkarc polka realclock an evolution of  the original polka system with the added capability of timebased  animation activations and durations  in addition polkarc  provides more natural ways to describe actions and their relationship  to objects  tech report    gitgvu9521 discusses these ideas in detail          waitfree consensus reflects the ability of n  distributed objects to agree in the presence of n1 failures  a number of object parameters can impact on this ability to agree  see    gitcc9404 for a discussion of these parameters and a look at the  properties of some distributed objects            teaching    scott has taed a number of courses at both the graduate and  undergraduate levels including   cs 6751  humancomputer interaction cs 1155 understanding and constructing proofs  cs 4753 human factors in software development and  cs 6152 theory of automata  his ta position has required that he  create and grade homeworks and projects assist students maintain  web pages and teach classes on occasion            personal    in his free time scott plays tennis for an alta team  with its best finishes city runnerup at b5 and division champs  at a6  he also less regularly plays other sports  including softball basketball and fencing  he even took up golf recently in an effort to better understand    his advisor  it didnt work and scott sank still further  into debt  for the past two summers while in the oak ridge area  scott got to ski skurf slalom disk and do other water activities  since he had a lake in his backyard  he spends too much time on the web as evidenced by the size of  his   hotlist  scott is tired of writing about himself in the third person              contact information    d scott mccrickard  college of computing  801 atlantic drive  georgia institute of technology  atlanta ga
