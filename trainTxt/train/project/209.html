ubiquitous telepresence     ut project statement    the main idea of ubiquitous telepresence ut is to allow users to project their physical presence anywhere on the internet  specifically users are given the ability to explore and interact with many remote physical environments eg all sites on the internet through remote sensing and manipulation devices  the plan for implementing ubiquitous telepresence is to build robotic or remotecontrolled units which we have called ubots at such low cost that they become as ubiquitous as television sets   ut project participants     michael doherty
