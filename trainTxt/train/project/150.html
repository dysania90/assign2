atm networks    computer networks research group  in the department of computer science   at the university of massachusetts       unlike traditional data networks future broadbandisdn bisdn widearea networks will be required to carry a broad range of traffic classes ranging from bursty variablerate sources such as voice and variablerate coded video to smooth constant bit rate sources moreover these networks will have to do so while providing a guaranteed performance or qualityofservice qos to these traffic classes  the problem of characterizing performance in such networks is thus particularly important since this must be done not only for the traditional offline tasks of dimensioning and design eg determining link bandwidths buffer capacities and processing capacities at network switchpoints but also for online  performancedriven  traffic control purposes such as sessionlevel admission control  in this section we outline our research aimed at providing the analytical tools and techniques for analyzing such networks and their diverse workloads and for designing and characterizing the properties of scheduling policies in these networks      traditional approaches towards performance evaluation of communication networks are generally not applicable in a highspeed network environment for a number of reasons  first the traffic in future highspeed networks is projected to be bursty often processing complex correlations in the cell arrival processes  simple markovian assumptions such as memoryless interarrival times are thus likely to be invalid in such networks  the gigabit rates of future highspeed networks also render simulation ineffective for systems of any realistic size  the very performance metrics of interest in a highspeed network will also be different  average delay will no longer be the primary performance measure and instead  secondary performance measures  such as probability of buffer overflow maximum packet delay and the tail of delay distributions must be considered  in this respect there is evidence that even relatively sophisticated performance models which work well for predicting average delay in the presence of correlated arrivals may be less wellsuited for computing these new performance measures of interest naga91 we also note that many previous performance evaluation techniques have been confined to studying the performance of the  aggregate traffic  generated by a set of  identical  sources at a  single  multiplexer in isolation in connectionoriented highspeed networks with qos guarantees it is clear that performance must be examined on a  persession  basis and in a  network  setting kuro92schu92 finally we note that given the potentially complex nature of network traffic it is becoming increasingly valuable to be able to broadly characterize properties such as optimality or near optimality of network control mechanisms which hold over a wide range of traffic models and assumptions  thus far however little work has been reported on this problem for traditional networks much less for highspeed networks     given the above considerations it is evident that new performance evaluation techniques will be required for the design and analysis future highspeed networks  furthermore given the qos requirements of such emerging standards as atm these techniques will also be needed for  online  performance driven traffic control purposes such as sessionlevel admission control  our research in these areas is aimed at addressing this need  our research divides broadly into four areas    we are developing a methodology for obtaining tight pessimistic bounds on the persession performance of a collection of heterogeneous sessions within a highspeed network kuro92 the metrics of interest are  the distribution of the packet delay and the probability of buffer overflow  our research is unique in that we are interested in computing provable performance  bounds  and in doing so on a  persession  basis in a very general  network  setting in which sessions may traverse a number of hops  this methodology is useful not only for the purpose of analyzing session and networklevel performance but also as a mechanism to be used for call admission where performance qos guarantees are to be provided  we conjecture that the bounds computed using the above methodology may sometimes be too loose to be of practical interest  in these cases it will be of interest to compute performance albeit in an approximate manner once again  in a  network  setting  we have thus also examined a number of approximate approaches towards evaluating the performance of heterogeneous sessions within a highspeed network schu91naga91schu92  the primary performance metric of interest is probability of buffer overflow  our research here is noteworthy in considering heterogeneous sources and in doing so in a network setting  we have developed a methodology for designing and analyzing the qualitative behavior of scheduling policies this is based on  sample path analysis and the theory of majorization  tows90  our focus is on a wide class of performance metrics including the average and maximum packet delay the probability of buffer overflow and the length of a buffer overflow burst  as discussed above this work is of particular interest and value in that it can characterize properties of scheduling mechanisms such as their optimality or near  optimality over a wide range of assumptions thus obviating the need for a potentially timeconsuming andor difficult casebycase performance analysis   we are also developing  routing policies for     highspeed networks hwan91hwan92  given the need to    provide qos guarantees to admitted sessions and thus implicitly    reserve resources for ongoing calls the routing problem in    highspeed networks shares much more in common with circuitswitched    routing algorithms than with     routing in traditional data communication networks    our research in hwan92hwan92a is aimed at    exploiting the similarities with routing in traditional circuitswitched     networks and adapting these policies for the case    of highspeed atm networks  of particular interest is the    fact that atm routing will be more processing intensive hwan92    and will be required to route traffic with heterogeneous    bandwidth
