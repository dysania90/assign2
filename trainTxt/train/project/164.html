contentlength 8693  acceptranges bytes      haystack home page     the internal haystack page has moved  send mail if you need to find it    this public page is under construction              welcome to the haystack  pull up some straw and make yourself at home            a great deal of research in information retrieval has been detached from the users who could eventually benefit from such research  on the one hand traditional ir research systems have been cut off by an inconvenient interface or limited to an unchanging text collection with a fixed set of evaluation queries that become increasingly out of date as time passes  on the other hand the recent surge in web search tools has resulted in many deployed ir systems with more convenient but often limited interfaces and generally fixed or at least nonmodifiable corpora    a few systems such as harvest or content routing have attempted to address the gaps between these two extremes focusing on the construction of a more flexible substrate which allows users and communities to build their own repositories or queries      the haystack project is aimed at the individual customization end of these more realistic living information retrieval systems  we are interested in building on customizable substrates such as those provided by harvest or content routing to create a community of individual but interacting haystacks personal information repositories which archive not only base content but also userspecific metainformation enabling them to adapt to the particular needs of their users  we believe that such a system will let us address several questions      how can individuals use an information retrieval system to        organize their own personal collection of information     how might an information retrieval system learn from its users   and evolve over time into a more effective system     as individuals build up their own collections and information   retrieval systems how can they search for information that might be   located in others collections especially when such information is   organized by information retrieval systems that may differ greatly   from their own      our first step towards this goal has been to design a simple and convenient user interface to and annotation format for an information retrieval system  our current annotations emphasize userindependent text metainformation but the format for and structure of these annotations are intended to encompass handgenerated and automatic userspecific annotations  the annotations themselves are firstclass documents in our system so that for example search information can be reified and treated as an indexable object     in our implementation we have chosen to detach the information retrieval engine from the user interface and annotation system specifying only that the engine should accept a natural language query and return documents that match under whatever criteria it uses we have begun by using the mg information retrieval system but are concurrently investigating other back ends including content routing harvest and an inhouse imagebased ir system     on top of this arbitrary engine we are implementing several interfaces for retrieval as well as annotation editing  the first is a webproxy based interface which allows users to connect to the information retrieval engine via their favorite web browser  to maximize ease of use we are also developing shell and emacsbased tools for talking to the collection  haystack is intended to archive any objects from which text can be extracted we are initially implementing or appropriating textifiers for ascii postscript html and scanned documents but have an architecture that is easily extensible to other documents types     it is our intent that the simple standalone version of haystack will be easy to integrate into everyday use  since we project that even a minimal system will be of use to people aiming to organize their mail file system and favorite web pages we therefore expect to attract a moderatesize community of users at mit  once the system is in use we will be able to leverage the annotation facilities to explore several questions     the first such question is how an information retrieval system will actually be used in practice  by gathering usage data with permission we hope to learn about the kinds of queries people typically use  are they usually boolean in nature  single words  do they tend to be overprecise and find no documents or do they overgeneralize and get swamped with useless results  how do they react to what comes back  what refinement strategies do they use each haystack will provide a userspecific set of answers to these questions      a second question is how a system might learn from interaction with its user  consider the scenario in which a user types an initial query q then undertakes several stages of refinement to home in on the document d he wants  for the future the system should learn that when the user types a query like q document d is likely to be relevant even if it does not appear to be a good match  the annotation system allows for both user and systemlevel support for this learning process  the system might annotate a document with terms that do not appear in it but that the user types when he expects to find that document  the user might also add keywords or mnemonic phrases to a document in the expectation of future searches for it  ultimately the system may be able to make userspecific generalizations based on automatically or manually entered optimization annotations     given that individuals are organizing the information they care about it is natural to ask how one user can benefit from the work of other users  consider that the typical way to search for a paper book is to ask ones officeneighbor for it  analogously we would like to let individuals search for information in other peoples haystacks  both to limit the costs of a search and to improve the filtering of what is returned it is important for the system to learn over time which other individuals are most likely to have information that a given user finds relevantthese haystack neighbors are the systems that should be queried first and whose results should be most trusted     another opportunity that this linking of haystacks creates is in connecting individuals to other people who can address their information need  the information i have stored in my haystack is likely a good indicator of my knowledge and interests  a question that matches a lot of material in my haystack is likely to be a question i can usefully answer  the haystack system can therefore serve as an information brokerage connecting questioners to experts       sharing haystacks also raises the issue of generalizing from individuals customization of their own haystacks to larger pooled datasets  this provides another opportunity to test the adaptability of query strategies and a test of the generalization of the underlying learning algorithms     the common thread among the above ideas is userspecific customization of information repositories and retrieval processes  these are issues that are possible to explore only in the hybrid world provided by the newest generation of information access tools  by developing the haystack system we will attract the community of users who will provide the necessary testbed for exploring these questions about evolving interacting customized information systems         hayfolk      david karger    lynn andrea stein
