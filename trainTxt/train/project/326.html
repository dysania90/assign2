distributed collaboration   if you are the average computer scientist distributed collaboration is a buzzword to you and you probably do not know much about this field that is because it is an emerging area not associated with a large body of knowledge or even a text book while this might be bad news if you are a practitioner it is actually very good news if you want to be a researcher since interesting open problems are easier to find in a new area moreover it is not an entirely brand new field  it is as an interdisciplinary area giving new angles to several traditional fields traditional computer science has assumed that a single user interacts with a computer program at any one time a whole range of issues emerge when you decide to violate this fundamental assumption by allowing multiple distributed users to simultaneously communicate with a program research in operating and distributed systems programming environments userinterface frameworks software engineering and transaction models has started to study some of these issues but there is much left to do so if you have an aptitude in any of these fields and specially in more than one of them then this might be the area for you    the people   this group was started by  john smith  when he introduced  kevin jeffay  and   don smith  to the idea of cscw computer supported cooperative work they have not since looked back using collaboration as a driving problem for much of their research this initial group developed the abc collaboration framework which includes a distributed hypermedia file system and a distributed shared window system abc was supported by a special  national science foundation  program to investigate collaboration technology this program also funded collaboration systems developed by  dave stotts  and  prasun dewan  who were then at maryland and purdue respectively but soon saw the light and joined unc they in turn have contributed to the spreading of the word specially to  jan prins  and  lars nyland  who are the newest members of the group  we expect  jim anderson  and  sid chatterjee  to soon start looking seriously at this area hussein abdelwahab  has been working with the group since its inception as an adjunct faculty member some of the faculty members at other universities we collaborate with are  rick furuta   john mchugh  and  john riedl  we are also working with bill oliver of afips who plans to be a client for much of the software we develop the diversity of this group has put it in a unique position to comprehensively address the broad agenda of this interdisciplinary area      some of the phd students who have been led into working in this area are   goopeel chung   brian ladd  john menges   eileen kupstas   jon munson  and  jaime navon  be sure to look at their home pages to get an idea of the kind of research topics they are investigating   current projects   some of the ongoing projects include  collaboration bus   composing new collaborative systems from existing singleuser and collaborative systems  caeti   investigating software infrastructure to support the development of multiuser k12 educational applications  mmm multiclient browsing   supporting enhanced browsing semantics over the www  collaborative software engineering   building infrastructure and tools for supporting collaborative software engineering  merging   bringing different distributed versions of a shared object to a common state  shared windows   supporting efficient multiple views of a shared window in x and java based environments and  nextgeneration www server   extending the web to support authorship   reading list   here is an  initial reading list  in case you want to study this area in more depth it is currently heavily biased by the tastes of the author of this page but we plan to expand it when others get a chance to give their input check the home pages of the people working on this project for papers written by them   courses   if you are interested in working in this area the courses for you are   242  advanced operating systems   243  distributed systems   232  realtime systems  and seminar courses on collaboration   research equipment   the colab room 156 houses most of the equipment available to the researchers of this group we have recently been awarded a large fiveyear equipment grant by the national science foundation to add among other equipment atm switches ten multimedia sgi indy workstations and six highend vr sgi maximum impact machines   related work at unc   the  graphics  and
