coprincipal investigators nicholas bambos  jason cong   eli gafni   mario gerla      objective  the major focus of this research is the design testing and prototyping of a novel highperformance optical interconnection network for supercomputers which is based on optically communicating mesh routers or crossbars and which is scalable the geographic coverage ranges from interdepartmental to campus and even to metropolitan areas the network provides very high speed multiple services supporting hybrid circuitswitched and datagram traffic and direct or multihop connections that are dynamically reconfigurable at a first networking level we locally interconnect workstations supercomputers peripheral devices mass memory etc through host interfaces at a higher networking level we use fully optical interconnects allowing communication between devices connected to distinct mesh routers a goal of this research is to capture the large latent distributed computational power of the network processors to be used for network control and management leading to an intelligent network  a main motivation for the research stems from the limitations observed in current supercomputer interconnect systems and from the opportunities offered by emerging communication technologies such as wdm optoelectronics for novel feasible system architectures  approach  we propose to overcome the usual interconnect problems by replacing the pointtopoint links with an alloptical interconnect system namely the high speed lans will be connected to an optical star or tree physical topology wavelength division multiplexing wdm will be used to subdivide the very large fiber bandwidth into several channels each of gbps bandwidth wdm channels supporting also time division multiplexing will be established between modules thus defining a dense virtual interconnection topology which is dynamically reconfigurable responding to changing traffic patterns  a pool of channels will be set aside for direct endtoend connections between mesh routers providing circuitswitched service for realtime traffic applications     the heart of the distributed supercomputer supernet is optimic  optical interconnect of myrinet ic chips optimic is a novel highperformance network consisting of myricom asynchronous pipeline crossbars apc interconnected by a wdm optical backbone it supports both circuitswitched and packet switched datagram traffic it achieves virtual topology reconfigurable interconnection through an optical star or tree and it bases its networking operations on the intelligent fabric of the network itself in optimic each network node ie apc is connected to local hosts to other nodes and to multiple optical channels via an optical channel interface oci  the optical interconnection and the use of their intelligence computational power for network operation and control will be supported by several technical innovations at various levels of network design including system integration and implementation interfacing distributed algorithms and protocols modeling and performance evaluation intelligent control and resource allocation etc     technology transition  among the technology transfer possibilities for the research we list the  following  fine grain metasupercomputer the ssn attributes would accelerate the  evolution of a networkbased operating system with precise synchronization  of dispersed processes fine grain process management on 100s1000s of  processor elements distributed checkpointing of jobs and dynamic entry of  new hosts    real time distributed network operating system low and predictable bounded latency makes ideal for wide area network control and data acquisition applications examples in the government include air force satcom network sdibe remote robot control for nasa applications and in the commercial arena oil refinery and power plant control avionics and spacecraft control systems control of electrical power distribution systems and factory automation    distributed image data base perusal scientific imagebased database archival and perusal systems are now being developed in several efforts such as the uc sequoia effort and the magic testbed nasa applications such as eos will require the capability of perusing through terabytes of data very quickly and interactively a low latency high throughput network will be essential for responding quickly to interactive control from the user datagram and sending image bursts back to the user streamscircuit switched      click here for the
