table of contents  galileo  project description publications related projects    sci at wisconsin  project description publications    project members     galileo at wisconsin      galileo is a project being conducted in the  computer architecture group at the university of wisconsinmadison  our project focuses on the medium to longterm evolution of processor and system architectures with an emphasis on the memory system  specifically we are studying what the relationship between the processor and main memory will be in future systems completely separate as today or integrated and if so to what extent    processing capability and bit storage may merge in at least two ways because of increasing offchip penalties in issuable instructions andor limited offchip bandwidth designers may place more and more capacity on the processor chip and module until eventually a sizable fraction of main memory resides onchip represented by the arrow labeled mop in the above diagram  a different possibility is the migration of processor capability onto the dram chips themselves eventually obviating the central processor see the iram arrow above  our specific research currently focuses on the following areas    examining the performance impact of large memory latencies and limited memory bandwidth in current and future microprocessorbased systems performance modeling of the various design

univeristy japan     sci at wisconsin our group is also closely involved with research relating to cachecoherent sharedmemory multiprocessor design specifically studying the scalable coherent interface coherence and transport layers we are using sci which is an ieee standard 15961992 as a base platform for  the exploration of our ideas the sci standard specifies a linkedlist based hardware coherence protocol  which includes support for efficient synchronization primitives  queue on lock bit or qolb as well as optimizations for different sharing patterns such as  pairwisesharing and fresh readsharing  the standard also includes a definition for an extremely highbandwidth 1 gbs low latency transport layer in between processing elements or individual clusters  we are currently performing scirelated research on the following topics     extending sci with logarithmicallygrowing sharing structures efficient hardware synchronization for sharedmemory multiprocessors a
