the performance of parallel programs it supports performance measurement modeling tuning and visualization     carnival measurements are based on predicate profiling which quantifies the time spent in each category of overhead during execution our first implementation of predicate profiling was implemented on the ksr1 we now have implementations for the sgi challenge multiprocessor the ibm sp2 a network of sun workstations running pvm and a cluster of alpha workstations     carnival is a novel attempt to automate the causeandeffect inference process for performance phenomena in particular carnival currently supports waiting time analysis an automatic inference process that explains each source of waiting time in terms of the underlying causes instead of simply identifying where it occurs we are now developing a similar technique to explain the causes of communication     our ultimate goal is to combine the accuracy of empirical performance measurement with the predictive power of analytic performance modeling towards that end carnival supports lost cycles analysis which uses a priori knowledge of the sources and characteristics of the overhead categories in parallel systems to guide and constrain the modeling process the lost cycles toolkit which we are integrating within carnival combines empirical modelbuilding techniques from statistics with measurement and modeling techniques for parallel programs     carnival is also a visualization tool that provides a link between performance measurements and the source code the interface presents the original source code in a window along the left hand side of the source is a greyscale scroll bar that indicates the amount of time spent in each portion of the source code summed across all processors along the right hand side of the source code are color bars that indicate the percent of time spent in each overhead category by that section of source code again summed across all processors popup windows are used during modeling and waiting time analysis     the carnival implementation comprises about 15000 lines of tcltk and c source code it has been installed at the cornell theory center and we plan to make it more widely available soon we are currently porting the instrumentation library the only machinedependent portion of the tool to clusters of dec alphas connected by the dec memory channel   related
