machine learning for cancer diagnosis and prognosis                  this page describes various linearprogrammingbased machine learning  approaches which have been applied to the diagnosis and prognosis of  breast cancer  this work is the result of a collaboration at the  university of wisconsinmadison between  prof olvi l mangasarian   of the computer sciences department and  dr william h wolberg  of the departments of surgery and human oncology          here is a copy of the  press release   distributed at the american cancer society science writers seminar in  march of 1994  it provides a good overview of this research              table of contents       diagnosis     prognosis     bibliography     citation in the popular press     local related links     other related links                diagnosis    this work grew out of the desire by dr wolberg to accurately diagnose  breast masses based solely on a fine needle aspiration fna  he  identified nine visually assessed characteristics of an fna sample which   he considered  relevant to diagnosis  in collaboration with prof mangasarian and  two of his graduate students rudy setiono and     kristin bennett a  classifier was constructed using the multisurface method msm of pattern   separation on these nine features that  successfully diagnosed 97 of new cases  the resulting data set is  wellknown as the   wisconsin breast cancer data          the image analysis work began in 1990 with the addition of   nick street  to the research team  the goal was to diagnose the sample based on a  digital image of a small section of the fna slide  the results of  this research have been consolidated into a software system known as   xcyt which is currently used by dr wolberg in his clinical  practice  the diagnosis process is now performed as follows       an fna is taken from the breast mass  this material is then  mounted on a microscope slide and stained to highlight the cellular  nuclei  a portion of the slide in which the cells are  welldifferentiated is then scanned using a digital camera and a  framegrabber board     the user then isolates the individual nuclei using xcyt  using a mouse pointer the user draws the approximate boundary of  each nucleus  using a computer vision approach known as snakes  these approximations then converge to the exact nuclear boundaries  this interactive process takes between two and five minutes per slide  here is an image showing  xcyt in use      once all or most of the nuclei have been isolated in this  fasion the program computes values for each of ten characteristics of  each nuclei measuring size shape and texture  the mean standard  error and extreme values of these features are computed resulting in  a total of 30 nuclear features for each sample     based on a training set of 569 cases a linear classifier was  constructed to differentiate benign from malignant samples  this  classifier consists of a single separating plane in the space of three  of the features extreme value of area extreme value of smoothness  and mean value of texture  by projecting all the cases onto the  normal of this separating plane approximate   probability densities of  the benign and   malignant points were constructed  these allow a simple bayesian  computation of probability of malignancy for new patients  these  densities are shown to the patient allowing her to judge the  confidence of her diagnosis by comparison to hundreds of previous samples        to date this system has correctly diagnosed 176 consecutive new  patients 119 benign 57 malignant  in only eight of those cases did  xcyt return a suspicious diagnosis that is an estimated  probability of malignancy between 03 and 07           a small subset of the source images used in this research can be found   here   these are very good  test cases for   image segmentation or object recognition algorithms  if your pet  segmentation algorithm can automatically identify all of the nuclei in  these images please email me streetcswiscedu and lets work together                prognosis      the second problem considered in this research is that of prognosis  the prediction of the longterm behavior of the disease  we have  approached prognosis as a functionapproximation problem using input  features  including those computed by xcyt    to predict a  time of recurrence in malignant patients using rightcensored data  our solution is termed   the recurrence surface approximation method rsa and utilizes a linear  program to construct a surface which predicts time of recurrence for  new patients  by examining the actual recurrence of those training cases  with similar predicted recurrence times we can plot the probability of  diseasefree survival for various times out to 10 years for an  individual patient  this capability has been incorporated into  xcyt and an example is shown   here  these survival curves plot the probability of diseasefree survival versus   time in years  the black diseasefree survival curve represents all patients in our  original study the red curve represents the probability of  diseasefree survival for the sample case  this particular case therefore  has an aboveaverage prognosis with a probability of being diseasefree  after 10 years equal to about 80        the rsa procedure can also be used to compare the predictive power of  various prognostic factors  our results indicate that precise  detailed cytological information of the type provided by xcyt  gives better prognostic accuracy than the traditional factors tumor  size and lymph node status  if corroborated by other researchers  this result could remove the need for the often painful axillary lymph   node surgery        chronological bibliography
