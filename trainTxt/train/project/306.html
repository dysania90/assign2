approach and principles maruti personnel        the maruti 30 system architecture     background  the purpose of the maruti project is to create an environment for the development and deployment of critical applications with hard realtime constraints in a reactive environment such applications must be able to execute on a platform consisting of distributed and heterogeneous resources and operate continuously in the presence of faults      the maruti project started in 1988 the first version of the system was designed as an objectoriented system with suitable extensions for objects to support realtime operation the proofofconcept version of this design was implemented to run on top of the unix operating system and supported hard and nonrealtime applications running in a distributed heterogeneous environment the feasibility of the faulttolerant concepts incorporated in the design of maruti system were also demonstrated no changes to the unix kernel were made in that implementation which was operational in 1990 we realized that unix is not a very hospitable host for realtime applications as very little control over the use of resources can be exercised in that system without extensive modifications to the kernel therefore based on the lessons learned from the first design we proceeded with the design of the current version of maruti and changed the implementation base to cmu mach which permitted more direct control of resources      most recently we have implemented maruti directly on 486 pc hardware providing maruti applications total control over resources the initial version of the distributed maruti has also been implemented allowing maruti applications to run across a network in a synchronized hard realtime manner      design goals  the design of a realtime system must take into consideration the primary characteristics of the applications which are to be supported the design of maruti has been guided by the following application characteristics and requirements    realtime requirements    the most important requirement for realtime systems is the capability to support the timely execution of applications in contrast with many existing systems nextgeneration systems will require support for hard soft and nonrealtime applications on the same platform     fault tolerance    many of the missioncritical systems are safetycritical and therefore have fault tolerance requirements in this context fault tolerance is the ability of a system to support continuous operation in the presence of faults    although a number of techniques for supporting faulttolerant systems have been suggested in the literature they rarely consider the realtime requirements of the system a realtime operating system must provide support for fault tolerance and exception handling capabilities for increased reliability while continuing to satisfy the timing requirements     distributivity    the inherent characteristics of many systems require that multiple autonomous computers connected through a local area network cooperate in a distributed manner the computers and other resources in the system may be homogeneous or heterogeneous due to the autonomous operation of the components which cooperate system control and coordination becomes a much more difficult task than if the system were implemented in a centralized manner the techniques learned in the design and implementation of centralized systems do not always extend to distributed systems in a straightforward manner     scenarios    many realtime applications undergo different modes of operation during their life cycle a scenario defines the set of jobs executing in the system at any given time a hard realtime system must be capable of switching from one scenario to another maintaining the system in a safe and stable state at all times without violating the timing constraints     integration of multiple requirements    the major challenge in building operating systems for missioncritical computing is the integration of multiple requirements because of the conflicting nature of some of the requirements and the solutions developed to date integration of all the requirements in a single system is a formidable task for example the realtime requirements preclude the use of many of the fault handling techniques used in other faulttolerant systems    design approach and principles  maruti is a timebased system in which the resources are reserved prior to execution the resource reservation is done on the time line thus allowing for reasoning about realtime properties in a natural way the timedriven architecture provides predictable execution for realtime systems a necessary requirement for critical applications requiring hard realtime performance the basic design approach is outlined below    resource reservation for hard realtime jobs    hard realtime applications in maruti have advance resource reservation resulting in a priori guarantees about the timely execution of hard realtime jobs this is achieved through a calendar data structure which keeps track of all resource reservations and the assigned time intervals the resource requirements are specified as early as possible in the development stage of an application and are manipulated analyzed and refined through all phases of application development     predictability through reduction of resource contention    hard realtime jobs are scheduled using a timedriven scheduling paradigm in which the resource contention between jobs is eliminated through scheduling this results in reduced run time overheads and leads to a high degree of predictability however not all jobs can be prescheduled since resources may be shared between jobs in the calendar and other jobs in the system such as nonrealtime activities there may be resource contention leading to lack of predictability this is countered by eliminating as much of resource contention as possible and reducing it whenever it is not possible to eliminate it entirely the lack of predictability is compensated by allowing enough slack in the schedule     integrated support for fault tolerance    fault tolerance objectives are achieved by integrating the support for fault tolerance at all levels in the system design fault tolerance is supported by early fault detection and handling resilient application structures through redundancy and the capability to switch modes of operation fault detection capabilities are integrated with the application during its development permitting the use of applicationspecific fault detection and fault handling as fault handling may result in violation of temporal constraints replication is used to make the application resilient failure of a replica may not affect the timely execution of other replicas and thereby the operation of the system it may be controlling under anticipated load and failure conditions it may become necessary for the system to revoke the guarantees given to the hard realtime applications and change its mode of operation dynamically so that an acceptable degraded mode of operation may continue     separation of mechanism and policy    in the design of maruti an emphasis has been placed on separating mechanism from policy thus for instance the system provides basic dispatching mechanisms for a timedriven system keeping the design of specific scheduling policies separate the same approach is followed in other aspects of the system by separating the mechanism from the policy the system can be tailored and optimized to different environments     portability and extensibility    unlike many other realtime systems the aim of the maruti project has been to develop a system which can be tailored to use in a wide variety of situationsfrom small embedded systems to complex mission critical systems with the rapid change in hardware technology it is imperative that the design be such that it is portable to different platforms and makes minimal assumptions about the underlying hardware platform portability and extensibility is also enhanced by using modular design with well defined interfaces this allows for integration of new techniques into the design with relative ease     support of hard soft and nonrealtime in the same environment    many critical systems consist of applications with a mix of hard soft and nonrealtime requirements since they may be sharing data and resources they must execute within the same environment the approach taken in maruti is to support the integrated execution of applications with multiple requirements by reducing and bounding the unpredictable interaction between them     support for distributed operation    many embedded systems need several processors to carry out their computations when multiple processors function autonomously their use in hard realtime applications requires operating system support for coordinated resource management maruti provides coordinated timebased resource management of all resources in a distributed environment including the processors and the communication channels     support for multiple execution environments    maruti provides support for multiple execution environments to facilitate program development as well as execution realtime applications may execute in the marutimach or marutistandalone environments and maintain a high degree of temporal determinacy the marutistandalone environment is best suited for the embedded applications while marutimach permits the concurrent execution of hard realtime and nonrealtime unix applications in addition the marutivirtual environment has been designed to aid the development of realtime applications in this environment the same code which runs in the other two environments can execute while access to all unix debugging tools is available in this environment temporal accuracy is maintained with respect to a virtual realtime     support for temporal debugging    when an application executes in the marutivirtual environment its interactions are carried out with respect to virtual realtime which is under the control of the user the user may speed it up with respect to actual time or slow it down the virtual time may be paused at any instant and the debugging tools used to examine the state of the execution in this way we may debug an application while maintaining all temporal relationships a process we call temporal debugging    principal investigators   dr ashok agrawala dr satish tripathi
