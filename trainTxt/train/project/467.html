complementarity problem net  as a result of more than three decades of research the subject of  complementarity problems with its diverse applications in engineering  economics and sciences has become a wellestablished and fruitful discipline within mathematical programming  several monographs  and surveys have documented the basic theory algorithms and applications  of complementarity problems and their role in optimization theory    this page serves as a center for information regarding research in complementarity problems  as such there is a listing of meetings of interest to the community some pointers to software for complementarity problems as well as links to other pages of interest a listing of researchers and some application areas are also given        table of contents      directory of researchers in complementarity     software for complementarity problems    applications of complementarity          relevant web links         directory of complementarity researchers     software for complementarity problems        mcplib   a collection of nonlinear mixed complementarity problems problem description and how to access the gams source files for these problems     complementarity toolbox for matlab   this evolving freely available toolbox consists of several mex and mfiles  these allow all the mcplib problems to be accessed from matlab without access to gams  the mex files give function evaluations and sparse jacobian evaluations  machine specific versions can be downloaded the path solver is also available in this toolbox more details below     solver interface to gams   this describes a library of routines that are available to help hook your solver to the gamsmcp modeling language contact stevegamscom rutherfordcoloradoedu or ferriscswiscedu for further details     miles   miles is an extension of the classical josephynewton method for ncp in which the solution to each linearized subproblem is computed via lemkes almostcomplementary pivot algorithm this newton point is used to define the newton direction which is then used in a damped linesearch  the merit function used measures both the violation in feasibility and in complementarity  miles also employs a restart procedure in cases where the newton point cannot be computed due to termination in a secondary ray  every linearized subproblem is rescaled to equilibrate the elements appearing in the data of the subproblem     path  runs under gamsmcp or directly under matlab the path solver applies techniques similar to those used in newton methods for smooth systems to a nonsmooth reformulation of the mcp  the algorithm consists of a sequence of major iterations each consisting of an approximation or linearization step similar to that of miles  the construction of a path to the newton point the solution to the approximation and a possible search of this path  when the newton point does not exists or the path cannot be entirely constructed a step along the partially computed path is taken before the problem is relinearized  a nonmonotone watchdog strategy is employed in applying the path search this helps avoid convergence to local minima of the norm function for the underlying nonsmooth equation and keeps the number of function evaluations required as small as possible  a list of solver options  is given in the document     nesqp the nesqp algorithm is based upon reformulating the ncp as a system of nonsmooth equations the nesqp algorithm implemented as a gamsmcp solver its robustness improved using a proximal perturbation strategy giving the  qpcomp algorithm the nonsmoothness of the equations is handled using directional derivatives of h     smooth   the smooth algorithm is based upon reformulating the ncp as a system of nonsmooth equations and then approximately solving a sequence of smooth approximations which lead to a zero of the nonsmooth system   at each iteration a smooth approximation to the original system is formed where the accuracy of the approximation is determined by the residual of the current point  this is implemented as a gamsmcp system     other solvers  have been implemented as subsystems of gams and are compared in this paper       applications of complementarity        engineering and economic applications of complementarity problems this paper lists many of the known applications of complementarity problems    mpsge a preprocessor for the gams modeling language that allows economic equilibrium problems to be formulated easily  see the gams  home page for further information     nems the national energy modeling system  there are several papers on related  algorithms and a paper giving an  overview of the project        relevant web links        look up  michael tricks operations research page  for some interesting or links    look up interiorpoint web  for information on interior point methods at the argonne national laboratories archive      last modified october
