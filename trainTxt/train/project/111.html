 operating systems  laboratory organization and tools  carol miller     html by william hicks and earl shannon    table of contents  introduction  operating system development tools   xcc as download odt busers xinu8   program development example  troubleshooting     introduction the operating systems laboratory of the computer science department is provided for students enrolled in upper level undergraduate and graduate operating system courses  this document contains a description of the computers in the lab and the software development tools available to students in these advanced classes       laboratory configuration  the operating systems laboratory often referred to as osl for the computer science department is located in daniels 205  this lab is a vital resource for two undergraduate courses csc 451 and csc 452 and the graduate level realtime operating systems course csc 574 the computers in the laboratory for csc 451 consist of a single sun sparc and five sun 360 xinu clients named friedpie fishstick onionring tatortot and frenchfry    hushpuppy  the sparc workstation known as hushpuppy is where student accounts are  located and xinu software development is done  hushpuppy uses the sunos operating system which is a 43 version of unix with system v release 32 extensions  it is connected to the campus network via ethernet and uses tcpip to communicate with other machines  hushpuppy can also be reached by using a hayes compatible modem through the ncsu campus dataswitch  university terminal servers or from other computer systems via internet using the address hushpuppycscncsuedu or just plain hushpuppy if you are currently in the ncsu internet domain    to telnet to hushpuppy you can also just click  here      sunos has many of the commands found on other campus machines such as aza the eos workstations and garfield some of which are running digital  equipments ultrix  familiarity with any of these systems will allow you to quickly become comfortable using sunos  help is available via the online manuals commonly called man pages  the following is an example to show how to display man pages for the sunos command ls which will list the contents of a directory        sun4man ls     hushpuppy responds with       reformatting page wait done   ls1v   user commands   ls1v   name ls  list the contents of a directory   synopsis ls aaccdffgillqrrstu1  filename    system v synopsis usr5binls abccdffgillmnopqrrstux filename     and continues with the remaining information on the ls command    xinu clients  there are five xinu clients  they are named fishstick frenchfry onionring tatortot and friedpie  they are sun 360 with 8 or 4 megabytes of ram two serial ports an ethernet connection and a scsi port  the console port one of the two serial ports on each of the five clients is connected to hushpuppy via a multiplexer  this connection allows the server machine to act as a front end to the xinu client and eliminates the need for an  additional terminal  the operating system also suppports a terminal  connected to the second serial port but which is not currently configured     the five target machines clients are connected to each other and to hushpuppy through an ethernet network  it is through this connection the clients download xinu executables created on the sparc hushpuppy  devices such as hard disks cdroms and scanners can be connected to the sun via the scsi port      contents   operating system development tools  xinu is a small operating system originally designed for the digital equipment lsi 11 computer but has been transported to other platforms it is for this reason that a xinu target machine is sometimes called an lsi  written by  douglas comer and associates at purdue university xinu and its development tools are used to explore the different aspects of operating system design xinu version 6 is discussed in comers book operating system design the xinu approach volume one  volume two of this text covers xinu version 7 xinu 6 is currently installed on hushpuppy and can be found in the directory  usrxinu  the c and mc68030 assembly source files for xinu 6 are located in the directory usrxinusrc xinu header files are in usrxinuinclude and the library files are located in usrxinulib    xcc c compiler for xinu  the command xcc invokes the c compiler assember and loader to produce object files motorola mc68030 assembly language files or xinu executables from input files located on hushpuppy  the input files can be c source files motorola 680xx assembly source files object files or libraries of object files  the distinction between the different types of files is made by the  suffix of the file name      suffix  file type  c  c source code  s  mc680xx assembly source  o   object file  a  object file library    for example xcc would assume the files mainc ioc and controlc to be  c source code and the file lowlevels to be an assembly module  it is  recommended that you use xcc to assemble routines written in assembly  language    below are the switches options sent to programs via the command line that xcc understands      switch  purpose  c  to suppress the loadinglinking phase of the    compilation and force xcc to stop after    producing o files from source programs   o output to name the final output file output   v  verbose output narrating each step of the  a    compile   dname  define name to the preprocessor as if by the    define directive   e  run only the macro preprocessor on the named    c programs and send the result to standard    output   idir  include files whose names do not begin with i    are always sought first in the directory of    the file argument the in directories named in    the i options then in directories on a     standard list   o  invoke the objectcode improver as part of the    c compilation   p   run only the macro preprocessor on the named c    programs and send the result to corresponding    files suffixed with i   s  compile the named c programs into assembly    language and leave the asemblylanguage output    in corresponding files suffixed with s without    assembling or loading the result   l  include the standalone startup routine to allow    downloading without xinu  the xcc command can be    used to generate modules for downloading that do    not contain the xinu operating system  the l    switch is used to create this standalone object file    when a standalone module is mode the linker uses     the libsaa library of functions instead of the usual    libxa and libca      for example to compile a c source file named mainc an assembly listing named lowlevels and the object ioo into an executable named prog1 use xcc in the following way       xcc o prog1 mainc lowlevels ioo  for more information about the above options consult the man pages on the sun c compiler cc command    as mc680xx assembler  the sun 360s are based upon the motorola 68000 family of microprocessors the command as can be used to assemble 680xx source files into machine code however the resulting binary file in not in the proper format for downloading  it is for this reason that you are encouraged to use xcc to do all your assembling  the assemble the file setups enter   xcc setups   download download executable to xinu client  the download command loads the absolute binary program image produced by xcc into the memory of the target machine  the name of the file to  download can be provided as an argument otherwise the name aout is assumed   the m option can be used to select a 360 to send your binaries to otherwise any available client machine is used  for example   download mfishstick prog1    will download the file prog1 to fishstick  if no client is available all are reserved by other users then download will display an error message    odt connect the user terminal to the console port on the xinu client  the command odt takes it name from the online debugging technique odt feature of the lsi 11 and pdp 11 computers  this feature is a rombased monitor which accepts console keyboard commands  the name odt has been kept  for historical reasons and to provide uniformity across different xinu platforms  the development tool odt is used to connect the users terminal to the console port on a client machine  input from the keyboard is sent to the 360 and output for the 360 is displayed on your terminal    to run a downloaded program enter odt at the prompt on the server machine you will see a message telling you to which 360 you are being connected this will automatically be the machine you selected previously when you downloaded your executable  press ampltreturngt a few times until a gt prompt appears  if you do not get a prompt or if it seems that a program is already running on the client then enter the key sequence  the backslash character followed by ampltcontrolgt repeatedly until the 360 responds with the correct prompt  enter b at the prompt to boot the client  this will load xinu and your executable into the memory of the machine  start your program by typing g 4000 and pressing   below is an example using the above instructions     sun4download prog1  using front end hushpuppy   using backend fishstick  downloading file prog1  sent xk bytes   download completed    note the x in the line sent xk bytes will be some number    sun4odt  using front end hushpuppy   using backend fishstick  using devttyx   note the x in the line using devttyx will be a device name such as m00   gtb  eeprom boot deviceboot le000  using ip address 15215832  98013a20  booting from tftp server at 15215833  98013a21  downloaded x bytes from tftp server    note the x in the above line will be some number   gtg 4000  at this point xinu will start and your program will begin execution to return to hushpuppy press ampltcontrolcgt  this ends the odt session and causes the connection between the frontend hushpuppy and a 360 to be broken  pressing ampltcontrolcgt does not cause the xinu client to stop executing  your program it may continue executing after odt has been exited   b   ampltcontrolcgtmachine released  sun4   if a target machine begins behaving strangely it may need to be reset  to reset a 360 connect to it using the odt command as shown above  at the  odt prompt enter k 2 the letter k followed by a space and then the number 2 and press   this will casue the client to reset perform a selftest then load any downloaded program into memory     two switches program options commonly used with odt are m and h   switch         purpose  mmachine name   causes odt to connect the user terminal to sun     named machine name an odt following a download     will automatically use the same 360 selected      by the download if the m switch is not used   h   allows this 360 to remain reserved while     another is also being used      for example odt mfishstick h will access fishstick and keep the reservation for those computers which have already reserved normally downloading and using odt to connect with one xinu client releases any other reservations    busers list the xinu client users       the command busers lists each of the 360s that is currently being reserved  and the login name of the user who is using the target machine example     sun4

example          any editor can be used to create source files this sample program is compiled using the xcc command and download with the xinu operating system to a sun 360 the system call getc is used to read characters form the terminal    c source program   include ampltconfhgt  main      char c   while cgetcconsole a   printfc c     end of sample program    the program is compiled using xcc    sun4gtxcc prog1c  prog1c   aout  5960 records in  371 records out   sun4gt   the output file aout is the absolute object image for the 360   sun4gt download aout  sun4gtodt  using fishstick   gt b

program executes until the letter a is typed press ampltcontrolcgt to release the target machine and return to hushpuppy  remember ending an odt session will not halt any programs that may be executing on a target machine      contents    working in xinu 8  adding commands to xinu 8 shell    put command in homexinusrcsysshellusercmds the home in this path is the directory  where you originally uncompressed and untared the file  in makefile in homexinusrcsysshell add to the userofil line   so it will compile new command the line should look something like this    userofil   usercmdsascdateo usercmdsxcato usercmdsxcpo    usercmdsxdateo usercmdsxechoo usercmdsxmounto    usercmdsxmvo usercmdsxrlso usercmdsxrmo    usercmdsxsleepo usercmdsxunmouo      usercmdsxcloseo usercmdsxkillo                       usercmdsmycommandso   run make in  homexinusrcsysshellusercmds to make  all the necessary object files  see using make in xinu8 below in cmdh add function name of command to list of externs the externs list should look like this after you have added mycommand  extern        int       xbpool      xcat        xclose      xconf       xcp         xcreat      xdate       xdevs       xdg         xecho       xexit       xhelp       xkill       xmem        xmount      xmv       xnet        xps         xreboot     xrf       xrls        xrm         xroutes     xsleep       xsnap       xunmou      xuptime     xwho       xfmdump     xrun       xpgstats       xprintpgtbl       xvmem       mycommand   add a line to define cmds so the shell knows what to run when you type a command in the first piece of info is the command the shell will recognize which should be in quotes followed by a comma the second  thing is a boolean variable that determines whether the command is  builtin or not unsure of the implications of this with regards to xinu now so just set it to false the third thing is the name of the function that will be called when you type the command from the shell prompt the cmds line looks like this   define       cmds    bpool        false          xbpool                       cat          false          xcat                         close        false          xclose                       conf         false          xconf                        cp           false          xcp                          create       false          xcreat                                                                                                                                      ruptime      false          xuptime                      sleep        false          xsleep                       snap         false          xsnap                        time         false          xdate                        unmount      false          xunmou                       uptime       false          xuptime                      who          false          xwho                         vmem         false          xvmem                                    false          xhelp                  command      false          mycommand    note when adding commands to usercmds make sure the name of the function has the same name as the file this is not absolutely necessary as long as the function to be run when a given command is typed in the shell corresponds with the function you think  you are running this link is setup in the cmdh file     the function should have the following structure      command mycommandstdin stdout stderr nargs args    int     stdin stdout stderr nargs    char    args      this function would be saved in a file called mycommandc      using make in xinu 8   make needs to be run in your xinu 8 directory to create the downloadable file which will be run on the sun 360s to do this there is a special script  already written for this specific task it is called makeall it should be located in the following directory     homexinusrcsys  to execute it you will probably have to tell the shell where the script is located since this directory is not in your path if your are in the directory  where makeall is located the line to execute it would be     sun4gtmakeall     getting a copy of xinu 8  to get a copy of xinu 8 just click here     this will get a copy of the tared and compressed file to untar and unzip the file you will need to do the following    uncompress the file  sun4gt uncompress xinu8tarz     untar the file   sun4gt tar xvf xinu8tar        this will create three directories docs programs and xinu the source code is located in xinu and can be changed as described above      trouble shooting in osl  trouble with xcc       the command xcc creates temporary object files in your current directory when compiling c programs and assembling 680xx programs  these temporary files have the same  names as the source files except with a o suffix it is therefore not possible to compile two modules with the same base name name excluding the suffix in the same directory such as readc and reads because the resulting object files will have the same name     trouble with download       if the hushpuppy responds to a download request with no suns available you must wait until someone releases a target machine as all are currently in use    trouble with odt       if a 360 refuses to respond at the point where you are expecting an odt prompt press  backlash then ampltcontrolgt multiple times if you see any prompt other than gt when you start an odt session then another users program is still running on the client use the same same key sequence described above to abort the other program then boot normally        if a ampltcontrolcgt does not return you to hushpuppy login to another terminal and kill your odt process or ask an operator to do this for you               stack overflow       the suns in osl are 32 bit machines and need twice as much memory to strore addresses and data as the 16 bit lsi 11 computers used in volume 1 of douglas comers book there  are example programs in the textbook that use the xinu system call create to spawn new processes you should double or triple the stack sizes given in the book for these programs to be sure each process has enough memory if a process runs out of stack space xinu will reply with the error message panic current process stack overflow   report problems with lab equipment       if a problem persists with a particular machine report it by sending mail to ops and use  another 360 mail sent to ops goes to all the operators and the first one to read your message will correct the problem          for
