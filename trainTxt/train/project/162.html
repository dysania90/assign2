introduction to our robots       the whole arm manipulator    the mit whole arm manipulator wam arm is a very fast force  controllable robot arm designed in dr salisburys group at the ai lab  the concept of whole arm manipulation was originally aimed at enabling robots to use all of their surfaces to manipulate and perceive objects in the environment central to this concept and our groups design efforts in general has been a focus on controlling the forces of interaction between robots and the environment to permit this the wam arm employs novel cable transmissions which are stiff low friction and backdrivable this in turn permits a lightweight design  to achieve good bandwidth in force control while in contact with the environment the arms design maximizes the lowest resonant frequency of the system and employs an impedance matching ratio between motor and arm masses this also enables the arm to achieve high accelerations while moving in free space     prof  slotine and his students have developed system architectures and control algorithms for both force controlled tasks and tasks requiring rapid and accurate free space motion  the algorithms also provide fast and stable adaptation of the arm to large variations in loads and environments            the talon     a new wristhand mechanism has been developed and replaces a previous forearm mounted system  the new wristhand known as the talon provides 3 additional powered freedoms one for grasping forces and two for orientation  the motors for the device are located in the forearm to minimize endeffector mass and maximize its workspace  the grasping mechanism is comprised of a group of 2 fingers which move against a group of 3 fingers such that two groups may be made to mesh together while encircling objects  finger inner surfaces are serrated to provide for high contact friction against rough rock surfaces and curved to enhance capturing large and small objects  fingers may deflect compliantly to accomodate to object geometry and finger deflections may be sensed to provide for monitoring grasp state  we also have studied the design of a miniature endeffector suitable for grasping small rocks and cylindrical objects  similar in spirit to the talon the new miniature endeffector utilizes slightly different kinematics to enlarge its feasible grasping volume            the fast eye gimbals    a more recent component of our system is our active vision system which is comprised of two hiresolution color ccd cameras with 50mm focal length lenses mounted on two degree of freedom gimbals  we have utilized cameras with a narrow field of view to give higher resolution images of typical objects this implies however that the cameras have to be actuated in order to pan and tilt so that they can cover broad scenes leading to an active vision system and an associated tradeoff between controller precision and image resolution narrowness of field of view     the actuators which we have implemented were designed in our lab and are known as the fast eye gimbals fegs  the fegs provide directional positioning for our cameras using a similar drive mechanism as the wam  the two joints are cable driven and have ranges of motion of  90 degrees and  45 degrees in the base and upper joint axes respectively  these two fegs are currently strategically mounted on ceiling rafters with a wide baseline for higher position accuracy using stereo vision methods the independent nature of the fegs allow us to position each one at different locations in order to vary the baseline or orientation of the coordinate frame as well as easily add additional cameras to provide additional perspectives           introduction our robots our research references         research projects     robust grasping in unstructured environments       one of our current projects funded by nasajpl is to develop a fundamental understanding of the problem of combining real time vision and touch sensor data with robot control to yield robust autonomous and semiautonomous grasping and graspstabilization the research is focused on providing conceptual and experimental support of planned and ongoing nasa missions utilizing earthorbiting and planetary surface robotics     we have implemented a highspeed active vision system a multiprocessor operating system and basic algorithms for acquisition and grasp of stationary spherical and cylindrical objects using coordinated robotic vision touch sensing and control  preliminary experiments on the tracking of moving objects have also been completed  concurrently research into an integrated wristhand design used for performing sensor guided grasps and a preliminary design for a nextgeneration miniature endeffector are being completed             robotic catching of free flying objects    another direction of our research funded by fujitsu furukawa and the sloan foundation is to accomplish realtime robust catching of free flying objects  we are currently focusing on spherical balls of various sizes  we are also experimenting with additional objects with different dynamic characteristics such as sponge balls cylindrical cans and paper airplanes        our system uses low cost vision processing hardware for simple information extraction  each camera signal is processed independently on vision boards designed by other members of the mit ai laboratory the cognachrome vision tracking system  these vision boards provide us with the center  of area major axis number of pixels and aspect ratio of the color keyed image  the two fast eye gimbals allow us to locate and track fast randomly moving objects using kalmanlike filtering methods assuming no fixed model for the behavior of the motion  independent of the tracking algorithms we use least squares techniques to fit polynomial curves to prior object location data to determine the future path  with this knowledge in hand we can calculate a path for the wam to match trajectories with the object to accomplish catching and smooth objectwam postcatching deceleration      in addition to the basic least squares techniques for path prediction  we study experimentally nonlinear estimation algorithms to give long term realtime prediction of the path of moving objects with the goal of robust acquisition  the algorithms are based on stable online construction of approximation networks composed of state space basis functions localized in both space and spatial frequency as a initial step we have studied the networks performance in predicting the path of light objects thrown in air further application may include motion prediction of objects rolling bouncing or breaking up on rough terrains     some recent successful results for the application of this network have been obtain in catching of sponge balls and even paper airplanes      click to view wam catching    click to view wam airplane catching      1995 photo courtesy of hank morgan
