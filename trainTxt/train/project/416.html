germany          dislop                 a research project on                 disjunctive logic programming            funding   persons   activities   publications   related projects   related links                     the long term goal of this  project is to develop a logic programming  system in which disjunction in the head of a clause and nonmonotonic  negation in the body of the clause are allowed  this goal is to be  achieved by appropriately combining classical deduction and   nonmonotonic reasoning systems  more specifically the project aims  to develop a disjunctive logic programming system based on  protein  theorem prover developed earlier by our     artificial intelligence research group             funding      this project is funded by  deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft dfg  a federal government agency that funds various basic research projects in  germany             persons involved      the project is headed by   profdr ulrich furbach  and  dr j rgen dix  two research scientists  dr ilkka niemel   and  dr chandrabose aravindan  are working exculsively on this project  in addition katrin erk and  dorothea sch fer  students working for their masters degrees are also involved in this project  marion herrmann  is the project secretary                 activities         j rgen dix       organized a       dagstuhl     seminar on disjunctive     logic programming and databases nonmonotonic aspects     the group participated in a workshop titled              integrating nonmonotonicity into automated reasoning systems       during        ecai 96  contact       ilkka niemel        for more details     the group presented a       poster       at the       poster session       of       jicslp 96     the group presented a       system description at       ki 96     the group is organizing       lpnmr 97       contact       j rgen dix or       chandrabose aravindan       for more details     the group will be organizing
