distribution conditions and official warranty disclaimer amanda was written by james da silva   amanda 230 alpha release notes  may 19 1996   the latest version of amanda is always available via anonymous ftp from ftpcsumdedupubamanda     please note this software is being made available asis umd is making this work available so that other people can use it  this software is in production use at our home site  the umcp department of computer science  but we make no warranties that it will work for you  amanda development is unfunded  the author maintains the code in his spare time  as a result there is no support available other than users helping each other on the amandausers mailing list  see below for information on the mailing lists    whats new since 226     a number of material bugs fixed including fixes incorporated into john   stoffels wpi patches to amanda which he called 2265  backup files larger than 2 gb now supported  the current limit is 231   kbytes 2 terabytes which should hold us for a few more years 12   support for gnutarbased backups  support for writing to multiple tapes sequentially in one run  support for multiple backups in parallel from the same client host  records from the curinfo database can be exported and imported tofrom a   textual format  this allows fixing a corrupted database by running the   text version through a script and reimporting it  individual records or   the entire database can be exportedimported   more details for these new features can be found in docswhatsnew    whats left to do for amanda 23     release engineering and porting on many platforms  update and extend the documentation  archival dumps via skipincr are not doing the right thing  pick many little nits  probably lots of other things     whats new since 225     a number of material bugs fixed  a lot of lint picked in the whole package  the documentation is now reasonably up to date  this version has been locally compiled and at least the client side tested   on the following systems  sunos 413 irix 52    solaris 23 bsdi bsd386 11    ultrix 42 netbsd 10    dec osf1 20 aix 32     i dont have any hpux machines locally to try it on but ive tracked   patches submitted by neal becker ltnealctdcomsetcomgt so im reasonably   confident that 226 shouldnt be far from the mark on that platform     whats new since 21   many things have changed since amanda 21  here are the major items    sysv shared memory no longer required on server side if mmap is available  supports gzip compression  supports use of mount names as well as device names in disk list   eg usr instead of sd0g  amanda now thinks in realtime  you may run it several times a day if    you wish and it wont get confused  supports kerberos 4 security as well as bsdstyle rhosts including   encrypting files over the net  the kerberos support is available as a   separate addon package  see the file kerberoshowtoget on the ftp   site  improved network protocol  faster startup no longer dump specific   hooks in place for nondump clients  clientside checks in amcheck  can check sanity of all client hosts very   quickly  supports multiple holding disks and load balances between them   more details are available in docswhatsnew    what is amanda   this is an alphatest release of amanda the advanced maryland automatic network disk archiver  amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a network to a single largecapacity tape drive  this release is currently in daily use at the university of maryland at college park computer science department backing up all the disks on all the workstations in the department currently over 70 gigabytes of data across more than 400 filesystems on more than 146 workstations and servers using a single 5 gigabyte exabyte exb8500  here are some features of amanda      written in c freely distributable    built on top of standard backup software bsd unix dumprestore and     later gnu tar and others    will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk blasting     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as we can write files to     tape  for example a 2 gb 8mm tape on a 240ks interface to a host     with a large holding disk can be filled by amanda in under 4 hours     does simple tape management will not overwrite the wrong tape    supports tape changers via a generic interface  easily customizable to     any type of tape carousel robot or stacker that can be controlled via     the unix command line    supports kerberos 4 security including encrypted dumps  the kerberos     support is available as a separate addon package see the file     kerberoshowtoget on the ftp site and the file docskerberos in this     package for more details    for a restore tells you what tapes you need and finds the proper     backup image on the tape for you    recovers gracefully from errors including down or hung machines    reports results including all errors in detail in email to operators    will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints no     more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network    includes a prerun checker program that conducts sanity checks on both     the tape server host and all the client hosts in parallel and will     send an email report of any problems that could cause the backups to     fail    can compress dumps before sending over net with either compress or gzip    can optionally syncronize with external backups for those large     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system     is down in singleuser mode since bsd dump is not reliable on active     filesystems amanda will still do your daily dumps    lots of other options amanda is very configurable     what are the system requirements for amanda   amanda requires a host that is mostly idle at night with a large capacity tape drive eg an exabyte or dat tape  this becomes the tape server host  all the computers you are going to dump are the backup client hosts  the server host can also be a client host  amanda works best with one or more large holding disk partition on the server host available to it for buffering dumps before writing to tape the holding disk allows amanda to run backups in parallel to the disk only writing them to tape when the backup is finished  note that the holding disk is not required without it amanda will run backups sequentially to the tape drive  running it this way kills the great performance but still allows you to take advantage of amandas other features  as a rule of thumb for best performance the holding disk should be larger than the dump output from your largest disk partitions  for example if you are backing up some full gigabyte disks that compress down to 500 mb then youll want 500 mb on your holding disk  on the other hand if those gigabyte drives are partitioned into 500 mb filesystems theyll probably compress down to 250 mb and youll only need that much on your holding disk  amanda will perform better with larger holding disks  we use 800 mb for our holding disk  actually amanda will still work if you have full dumps that are larger than the holding disk amanda will send those dumps directly to tape one at a time  if you have many such dumps you will be limited by the dump speed of those machines    what systems does amanda run on   amanda should run on any modern unix system that supports dump has sockets and inetd and either system v shared memory or bsd mmap implemented  in particular amanda 230 has been compiled and the client side tested on the following systems  sunos 413 irix 52  sunos 55 bsdi bsdos 21  ultrix 42 netbsd 10  dec osf1 32 aix 32 we only run the server side under sunos 413 but it compiles on all those platforms and i have no reason at this time to beleive it will not work  in addition i have tracked patches for the following systems that we dont run in house  freebsd  linux  hpux  nextstep    how do i get amanda up and running       docsinstall contains general installation instructions     docssystemnotes contains systemspecific information     docskerberos explains installation under kerberos 4     docstapechangers explains how to customize the changer interface     docswhatsnew details new features    who do i talk to if i have a problem   amanda is completely unsupported and made available asis  unfortunately i just dont have the time to answer all user questions and help all new sites get started    i do maintain the following mailing lists for those interested in amanda
