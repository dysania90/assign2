this effort special emphasis is placed on dataparallel programming and scalable parallelism      to achieve this goal researchers are developing a coordinated programming system that includes compilers and tools for fortran d an extended dialect of fortran that supports machineindependent dataparallel programming the tools support a variety of parallel programming activities including intelligent editing and program transformation parallel debugging performance estimation performance visualization and tuning and automatic data partitioning      research efforts also include validation of the compilers and tools on realistic applications as well as investigations of new functionality to handle irregular computations parallel io and automatic differentiation using the program analysis infrastructure developed for the project     fortran d language and compilers     existing languages for parallel programming on scalable parallel systems are primitive and hard to use they are primitive in the sense that each one reflects the architecture of the target machine for which it is intended making programs written for current parallel systems highly machinedependent as a result there is no protection of the programming investment on parallel machines  a program written for one target machine may need to be completely rewritten when the nextgeneration machine is available this situation is the principal impediment to widespread use of scalable parallel systems for science and engineering problems      to address this problem researchers have developed fortran d a set of extensions to fortran 77 and fortran 90 that permit the programmer to specify in a machineindependent way how to distribute a programs principal data structures among the processors of a parallel system in addition fortran d makes programming easier than it is with explicit messagepassing because programmers can write codes that use a shared name space independent of the target architecture programmers find a shared name space easier to use than a distributed name space because data placement and access issues can be ignored using sophisticated compiler techniques these highlevel programs can be compiled for both simd and mimd parallel architectures     the fortran d research effort has led to prototype compilers for the intel paragon and thinking machines cm5 for both fortran 77d and fortran 90d in addition the fortran 90d compiler has been ported to a number of other machines including the intel paragon ncube2 and a network of workstations compilers for other machines such as the simd maspar mp2 are under development the strategy for all these compilers is based upon deep program analysis aggressive communication optimization advanced codegeneration techniques and the use of sophisticated computation and communication libraries the effectiveness of these methods is being evaluated using a suite of scientific programs developed by affiliated researchers at syracuse university      high performance fortran hpf    fortran d was a major impetus behind the definition of high performance fortran hpf the high performance fortran forum which produced the definition of hpf includes representatives from industry academia and government laboratories the fortran d compilers produced in part by the rice compiler group are being used as models for several commercial hpf compilers thus the project has established an efficient technology transfer mechanism by which new features in fortran d once demonstrated may be included in a future round of hpf definition hpf home page     irregular problems    the fortran group also works closely with applications scientists and engineers working on irregular scientific problems such as computational fluid dynamics computational chemistry computational biology structural mechanics and electrical power grid calculations key aspects of the research associated with irregular scientific problems focuses on the development of portable runtime support libraries which 1 coordinate interprocessor data movement 2 manage the storage of and access to copies of offprocessor data 3 support a shared name space and 4 couple runtime data and workload partitioners to compilers these runtime support libraries are being used to port application codes to a variety of multiprocessor architectures and are being incorporated into the fortran d distributedmemory compilers for a list of technical papers on irregular problems see the d systemtechnical papers web pages      the d system  in 1992 researchers at rice university set out under arpa funding to build a suite of prototype tools that support development of programs in fortran d an abstract machineindependent parallel programming language the tools emerging from this research are collectively being called the d system  to date research has focused on four key areas an intelligent editor for fortran d that provides feedback on the analysis and parallelization performed by a fortran d compiler developed at rice advances in automatic data distribution research performed at rice joint work on performance analysis of fortran d programs with collaborators at the university of illinois and overhaul and integration of a program analysis repository with the interprocedural analysis system to provide a firm basis for the development of efficient wholeprogram analysis tools d system home page    the d system grew out of a collection of tools called parascope which was initially designed to support development of fortran programs with explicit parallelism in the form of parallel loops one difference between parascope and the d system is that parascope focuses on shared memory machines whereas the d system is targeted to distributed shared memory dsm machines parascope home page    related projects members of the fortran group are involved in several additional collaborations that are capitalizing on the available software infrastructure for instance researchers at rice university and argonne national laboratory are continuing to enhance adifor an automatic differentiation tool for fortran built upon the parascope infrastructure to support sensitivity analysis of large simulation codes for use in multidisciplinary design optimization by members of the crpc parallel optimization group adifor home page    the massively scalar compiler project mscp at rice is exploiting the interprocedural analysis engine developed for parascope and is also investigating interactions between parallelizing transformations and scalar node performance mscp home page    the fortran group is also collaborating with the crpc parallel paradigm integration project to investigate ways of integrating parascope and fortran dstyle data decomposition directives into fortran m a modular version of fortran syracuse university is coordinating an arpa activity to set up a parallel compiler runtime consortium this involves other sites and aims to design and implement common runtime support for parallel fortran c and ada for both data and task parallelism finally rice university is an active collaborator in a project by the intel delta consortium to develop software support for parallel io the fortran project researchers will develop and implement extensions to fortran d that support outofcore arrays which are too large to fit into the main memory of even a massively parallel computer system      people present members of the fortran tools effort include vikram adve alan carle keith cooper ken kennedy charles koelbel john mellorcrummey linda torczon and scott warren to meet the people behind a specific fortran tools project see the home page for that project          adifor  the d system  parascope
