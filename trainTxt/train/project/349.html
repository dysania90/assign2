thomas c henderson pi     department of computer science  university of utah  salt lake city utah 84112 usa         under the auspices of the nsf cise infrastructure  award cda   9024721  we have pursued a number of computeraided prototyping activities at the  department of computer science      we are working on the design and prototyping of software vlsi and electromechanical systems prototyping of such complex systems typically  involves the integration of dissimilar entities as mechanical parts software electronic hardware sensors and actuators our goal is to develop  prototyping  environments in which many types of information involved in  system  design can be combined in a coordinated way       we are very interested in building systems that require a heavy interdisciplinary interaction between a number of engineering disciplines the national needs in robotics automation manufacturing and intelligent systems are pushing scientists and engineers to learn more about different disciplines to be able to build coherent systems using computers to build platforms and environments for various prototyping activities in those fields is becoming a necessity the end product of research of this highly  interdisciplinary nature would be              prototyping environments software and hardware that allow the  concurrent design of engineering systems manipulators mobile robots electromechanical structures mems operating systems and schedulers for manufacturing applications      actual tools hardware and software systems and machines the end applications of the developed environments and platforms can range gtfrom realtime distributed operating systems for specialized machines and electromechanical equipments to mobile robots for specific tasks to micronano sensors actuators and manipulators to realtime visualizations of biological entities under outer space constraints to process plans for manufacturing under tolerance requirements           the interdisciplinary nature of the computeraided prototyping research  provides exciting opportunities to develop new and efficient algorithms and strategies for coordinating the efforts of the different groups involved  we believe that graduating engineers especially in the fields of computer science and engineering and electrical engineering should have  much more interdisciplinary knowledge about other engineering physics and mathematics areas than what they currently have on the average the interdisciplinary nature of our research provides an exceptional educational environment for those involved in the work our practice is to  insure that each research associate is aware of and contributes to all aspects of the big project not just the individual research problem he or she is working on at the time the intention is to produce graduates with a depth and breadth of experience which makes them especially well qualified to tackle demanding problems in science and engineering      the united states is experiencing a major economic battle in the global market place the main justification for research of this nature is that a success will put us in a better competitive position visavis the rest of the world if the approach to computeraided prototyping and its use to solve reliably efficiently modularly and rapidly a number of problems within electromechanical and physical systems design and modeling realtime software and hardware controllers monitors and observers succeeds then we stand to significantly impact prototyping automation and manufacturing            during the past three years we have been working on the coordination and integration of the efforts of the different groups involved in the computeraided prototyping projects at the department of computer science in particular we are working on developing theoretical and experimental tools environments and systems for integrating  sensing robotics cadcam   languages and vlsi  efforts within a number of cise projects  the cise reverse engineering and inspection project has been a successful project which started in september 1992 and significant results ensued  that project led to the sam sensing for advanced manufacturing project and the featurebased reverse engineering paradigm which is a huge undertaking that has been ongoing since august 1993 with four faculty and 4  6 students working on it under the direction of professors  bill thompson  and  thomas henderson        the cise robot prototyping environment project  resulted in a  concurrent and flexible design environment for prototyping robots  in addition to the urk utah robot kit robot in the hybrid systems control project we are working to develop a graphical des discrete event system hybrid controller simulator and analysis framework the framework allows for the control simulation and monitoring of dynamic systems that exhibits a combination of symbolic continuous discrete and chaotic behaviors and includes stochastic timing descriptions probabilistic transitions controllability and observability definitions temporal timed state space petrinets and recursive representations
