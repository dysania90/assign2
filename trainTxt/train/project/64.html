centre for systems science         affiliated laboratory                  members of the computational vision lab at sfu conduct research into   machine vision and image processing with emphasis on computational models  of colour vision      dr   brian funt  is the director of the lab        overview                                images for automated gesture tracking            computational vision can be thought of as enabling  computers to use visual information  like many problems in artificial  intelligence its something people do so easily they barely think  about it but a very complex problem for a machine            our primary focus in the vision lab at sfu is in understanding  colour how are colours perceived how can colours be reproduced accurately  on different media in what ways does colour help in understanding images   understanding colour is a much more difficult problem than most people  suspect often poor colour rendition results more from our limited  understanding of colour perception than it does from limitations of our  colour producing devices         we subscribe to a computational view of colour namely that human  perception and use of colour can be explored and explained as  computations  the fundamental problem of colour is to explain how we  see colours as relatively stable despite the fact that the light  reflected into our eyes from an object varies dramatically with the  light illuminating the object colour and computers have become much  more intertwined in recent years as colour displays and colour  printers have become more affordable since colour is a perceptual  not a physical quality it is crucial to have a good model of how we  perceive colour in complex environments if we are to get predictable  results from these devices          colours are difficult to reproduce correctly but why  while weve  all experienced untrue colour while using home video cameras or  viewing prints from our local photofinisher now we have colour  printers frustrating us with colours that look very little like the  nice colours we previewed on our crts  when the colour doesnt look  right its natural to feel that the printer and monitor are not  calibrated properly and of course perhaps theyre not but thats  not the fundamental problem  the fundamental problem stems from the  fact that colour reproduction simply is not a matter of reproducing  identical physical phenomena as it is in the case of sound  reproduction in which a similar pattern of sound waves is recreated  but rather a matter of creating perceptual equivalences        for us to build machines that reproduce colours accurately or to make  effective use of colour in robotics requires that we understand human colour  perception and the last decade has produced many interesting new  computational theories of colour coming from both computer science and  psychology a central concern of these theories is to describe how colour  depends or does not depend on the incident illumination  a coloured surface  cannot be seen unless we shine some light on it but the spectrum of the  reflected light depends on the product of the spectrum of the incident  lights spectrum and the surfaces reflectance  its natural to think of a  surfaces colour as a feature of the surface itself but the spectrum of the  light energy reaching the eye has the two factors of illumination and  reflectance confounded into one in order to determine the true surface  properties the effect of the illumination must be taken into account           colour correction results                    in the upper left is the image of a scene taken under an orangish  tungsten light which has the effect of turning the background overly  green and the whites a bit yellow in the bottom right is the target  image of the same scene but under the standard illumination for which  the camera is calibrated since we cannot always control the  illumination our goal is to correct automatically the colours in the  input image so that they will look like those in the target  image the fuzziness of the images is due to a high jpeg compression  factor concentrate on the colours       the top right is a corrected image produced by the standard  greyworld colour balancing algorithm which assumes that the average  of all the colours in the scene is grey  in the bottom left is the  much better result produced by our new more sophisticated algorithm  developed in the vision lab  as you can see the result of our new  algorithm is much closer to the target image than that produced by  the greyworld algorithm                    other links                                        dynamic   site   index           simon fraser university   home page          sfu computing science
