department of computer science  at the  university of illinois at urbanachampaign  under the direction of  professor dan reed   the members of the group investigate the interaction of architecture system software and applications on massively parallel computer systems major research topics include   performance instrumentation and data analysis tools  integration of  data parallel compilers hpf  and performance analysis  virtual reality techniques  for performance data immersion and realtime adaptive control  portable parallel file system software  for data caching and staging experiments on parallel inputoutput systems and  inputoutput characterization studies      a variety of the groups   papers  are available in postscript form a description of some of the groups computing facilities is also available     in addition there is more general information on the national  high performance computing and communications hpcc program   on  the arpa hpcc program  and   software and tools
