interdisciplinary group comprising members from six sfu units  computing sciences linguistics mathematics centre for systems science  education engineering two ubc units linguistics computinc sciences  and from the university of victoria and aizu university in japan    area  logic programming is the art of using logic to describe knowledge in a  more humanoriented way than is possible with traditional programming  languages this is achieved by describing a problem domain in terms of  facts and rules written in a simple subset of firstorder logic a hidden  theoremprover can then solve a particular problem in that domain by  deducing as needed further facts from the facts and rules stored thus we  can program declaratively largely in terms of what needs to be done  rather than of how to do it logic programming has become the heart of the  fifth generation computing project    objectives  the groups objectives are      to further the state of the art on the theoretical and practical         aspects of developing declarative programming tools in particular         logic programming functional programming constraint logic programming         and logic grammars    to investigate the uses of these tools for concrete fifth generation         computing applications and to facilitate result transfers and         collaborations with other academic units and with industry    specific research interests          building on existing logic or functional  programming tools our group develops new tools eg logic grammars  investigates their theoretical and implementation aspects and develops  fifth generation software in areas such as natural language processing  front ends to knowledgebased systems analysis generation and  translation linguistic theory automation deductive databases knowledge  representation constraint logic programming hardware design  probabilistic systems and expert systems related areas such as neural  networks and parallelism are also investigated      collaborations group members have a solid record of successful  collaboration with industry including a recordsetting research contract  with ibm canada for generating machinereadable error messages a research  contract with the french government for the automatic consultation of  industrial catalogues in french and two research contracts with the  canadian workplace automation research centre in laval for the automatic  translation of agricultural reports the group also has collaboration  agreements with european universities for discussing further potential  collaborations please contact the groups director dr verampocutenica dahl at  604 2913372    equipment         the groups laboratory located in asb 10855 contains a sun  sparcstation ipx which runs quintus prolog a macintosh  lcii which runs  als and lpa prolog and ibm at personal computer and several video  terminals both the sparcstation and the mac were purchased with nserc css  and prg equipment grants the ibm at  and the terminals were purchased with  funds from an ibm sur grant and an nserc operating grant respectively    acknowledgements         the group gratefully acknowledges financial support from  nserc css and prg in the form of infrastructure and equipment grants and  is also grateful to sfu and css for the use of their facilities
