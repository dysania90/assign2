visualization based on lattices       bill hibbard brian paul chuck dyer       we are defining a foundation for data visualization based on the  idea that a visualization process is a function from a set of  data objects called a data model to a set of displays called  a display model  a prototype system called   visad  has been implemented based upon our ideas          we are guided by the following principles      scientists develop mathematical models of nature and data objects  represent the objects of mathematical models  mathematical objects  frequently contain infinite precision real numbers and functions  with infinite domains whereas computer data objects contain  finite amounts of information and are thus approximations to the  mathematical objects they represent    computer displays contain finite amounts of information ie  they contain finite numbers of pixels their colors are chosen  from finite palettes animation sequences contain finite numbers  of frames etc and are thus approximations to ideal displays    because of the close relationship between data and computation  a data model should be appropriate for the data objects of a computational  model such as a programming language    the purpose of data visualization is to communicate the information  content of data objects  in particular we define expressiveness  conditions on the mapping from data objects to displays such that  displays should encode the facts about data objects and only  those facts    a visualization system should be complete in the sense that it  implements any function from data objects to displays satisfying  the expressivenss conditions        we can define an order relation between data objects based on  how precisely they approximate mathematical objects and we  can define an order relation between displays based on how  precisely they approximate ideal displays ie based on voxel  resolution etc  these order relations define lattices of  data objects and displays  therefore we can model the visualization  process as a function du gt v from a lattice u of data objects  to a lattice v of displays  we can interpret the expressiveness  conditions in this context and show that d satisfies the  expressiveness conditions if and only if it is a lattice isomorphism        we can define a particular lattice us appropriate for scientific  data objects  these data objects are built up from primitive  variables that we call scalars eg time latitude radiance  and temperature by tuple and array data type constructors  eg arraytime of temperature is a data type appropriate  for a time series of temperatures  thus the lattice us contains  the data objects of a scientific programming language  we can  also define a particular lattice vv of displays in which a display  is a set of voxels  each voxel is specified by a set of graphics  primitives that we call display scalars eg a pixels location  and size in a volume its color and its place in an animation  sequence          we can show that functions d us gt vv satisfying the expressiveness  conditions are just the class of functions defined by mappings from  the scalars used for primitive variables in data objects to the  display scalars that specify graphics primitives of voxels  of  course designers of scientific displays already assume that   primitive variables are mapped to graphics primitives  for example  given a data object of type arraytime of temperature it is  natural to display it as a graph with time along one axis and  temperature along another  the remarkable thing is that we  do not have to take this way of designing displays as an assumption  but that it is a consequence of the more fundamental expressiveness  conditions        we are developing and implementing a system called  visad  that allows scientists to experiment with algorithms steer their  computations and visualize the data objects they create in their  programs  the lattice us defines the data objects of the  visad programming language the system implements the lattice vv  of displays and data can be displayed using any function that  satisfies the expressiveness conditions however the implementation  is not quite precise  just as data flow systems define a  user interface for controlling data display based on abstraction  of the rendering pipeline the visad system defines a user interface  for controlling data display based on the abstraction of  mappings from scalars to display scalars        it is possible to define data lattices for the recursively defined  data types ie complex linked types such as trees used in  generalpurpose programming languages and for the abstract data  types and object classes in objectoriented programming languages        lattices provide a rigorous foundation for visualization  in particular  they can help us to develop an analytical alternative to the usual  approach of defining a visualization process d constructively by  writing a specialpurpose program for computing a display du for  a specific data object u
