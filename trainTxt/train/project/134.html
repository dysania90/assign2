design automation research group is an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary group composed faculty from  computer science department and electrical engineering department  the research focus is to promote productivity of engineering system design using rapidly improving information technology it includes how to model the design manage the design manufacturing process validate the correctness of design and support the life cycle of the product  research projects have been supported by government such as nsf air force and industries such as ford      faculty          moon jung chung

moon jung chung and anthony wojcik    as the complexity of products increases companies need to develop solid and effective process management for various aspects of production allowing them to promote productivity and to fully utilize the rapid progress in information technology effective design process management is crucial to the survival of industries in global competition especially for the michigan automotive industry  our approach is based on formal modeling of design process using process grammar  this research work has been supported by the air force wright patterson laboratory and system engineering research institute      parallel simulation    principal investigator moon jung chung    simulation is a bottleneck in a design process  the focus of the research is on parallel vhdl performance simulation with the support from dod hpc modernization program  we are developing a parallel simulation engine targeted for the sp2 machine which can achieve a speedup up to 100 times compare to sequential simulation     reengineering of digital circuits     principal investigators anthony wojcik moon jung chung bill punch and jon sticklen    of considerable interest in the design automation community is the problem of reengineering or redesign of electronic circuits  the basic problem is to take a given design and to respecify or remanufacture an electronic part board or system  the key problem is that original design information may be missing or incomplete hence redesign starts with only partial knowledge of the target system and must infer original specifications  our approach to this problem incorporates the use of formal methods  formal methods refers to the collection of approaches  based on mathematical logic and formal proof techniques used for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems our work includes the use of a variety of formal methods including automated reasoning genetic algorithms and knowledge based systems      verification of properties of digital systems     principal investigator anthony wojcik    as systems become ever more complex it becomes increasingly important to be able to verify properties about systems clearly one property is that the system functionally implements the intended specification  however there are other properties of interest including faulttolerance and security  a critical problem is the modeling of properties of systems and then the verification of the properties  it is clear that simulation alone cannot be used to verify properties for that reason the use of formal methods continues to be of great importance  formal methods refers to the collection of approaches based on  mathematical logic and formal proof techniques used for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems  our work is concerned both with the use of appropriate representations for modeling systems and properties of systems and the application of  techniques incorporating automated reasoning systems prolog and  other approaches in order to prove properties of systems      improved placement methodolgy for low power vlsi circuits    principal investigator michael shanblatt    graduate student manuel jimenez     reducing the amount of power dissipated by integrated circuits has become an issue of major concern in the design of digital vlsi systems among the factors pushing for power efficient circuits are the tight energy budgets of portable computing and communication devices the reliability concerns of the circuits themselves and the packaging and cooling costs associated with power hungry devices this project involves the development of a new placement approach in very large scale integration vlsi designs aimed at producing layouts of circuits with reduced power dissipation more specifically a placement methodology for digital vlsi circuits is under development whose objectives include minimizing the power dissipation of the resulting circuit while maintaining the estimated wire length and layout within preestablished bounds
