house     the mobile robotics and shape recognition group is an informal  grouping of people and projects at the centre   the group has at least three  mobile robots sporting a collection of sensors including sonar video  biris and infrared reflectance depending on the current experiments  in progress  the primary computing resources are sgi indigos  and indys some sun sparcs and a few other computing devices integrated into the  general cim computing environment   last update october 1996      this group is involved in issues of form representation and discovery this relates specifically to the    exploration and representation of unknown environments using mobile robots   and the representation and recognition of objects  key technical foci are the abstraction of shape models across scale the relationship between signals and symbolic descriptions     some of the problems we are interested in include the following how can a moving observer such as a robot recognize where it is  how can it build but a virtual reality model of its world for use by a human operator this is important for tasks such as remote inspection how can a robot learn efficiently about where it is  how can a group of robots collaboate efficiently     a typical prosaic objective create a robot than can learn your office over the weekend      it is delivered on friday you open the box leave it on the

multirobot collaboration     g dudek in collaboration with professors  e milios and   m jenkin  of york u and  d wilkes at ontario hydro  we are interested in elaborating a taxonomy for systems of multiple mobile robots  the specific issues we are foc using on are the relationships between interrobot communication sensing and coordination of behaviour in the context of position estimation and exploration a short paper describing a trial experiment in this context is   available in postscript form       mapping using weak information     g dudek in collaboration with professors  e milios and   m jenkin  of york u and  d wilkes at ontario hydro   autonomous navigation using sensory information often depends  on a usable map of the environment  this work deals with the  automatic creation of such a maps by an autonomous agent  and the  minimal requirements such a map must satisfy in order to be useful  one aspect of this work  is the analysis of how uncertainty either in the map or in  sensing devices relates to the reliability and cost of navigation and  and path planning  another aspect is the development of sensing  strategies and behaviours  that facilitate reliable selflocation and map construction       probabilistic sonar understanding    simon lacroix grogory dudek       pose estimation from image data  without explicit object models    g dudek chi zhang  we consider the problem of locating a robot in an initiallyunfamiliar  environment from visual input the robot is not given a map of the  environment but it does have access to a limited set of training  examples each of which specifies the video image observed when the  robot is at a particular location and orientation  such data might  be acquired using dead reckoning the first time the robot entered an  unfamiliar region using some simple mechanism such as sonar to avoid  collisions in this paper we address a specific variant of this  problem for experimental and expository purposes how to estimate a  robots orientationpan and tilt from sensor data  performing the requisite scene reconstruction needed to construct a  metric map of the environment using only video images is difficult  we avoid this by using an approach in which the robot learns to  convert a set of image measurements into a representation of its pose  position and orientation this provides a em local metric  description of the robots relationship to a portion of a larger  environment  a largescale map might then be constructed from a  collection of such local maps  in the case of our experiment these  maps express the statistical  relationship between the image measurements and camera pose the  conversion from visual data to camera pose is implemented using  multilayer neural network that is trained using backpropagation  for extended environments a separate network can be trained for  each local region the experimental data reported in this paper  for orientation information pan and tilt suggests the accuracy  of the technique is good while the online computational cost is very  low        spatial abstraction and mapping    p mackenzie g dudek   this project involves the development of a formalism and  methodology for making the transition from raw noisy  sensor data collected by a roving robot to a map composed  of object models and finally to a simple abstract map  described in terms of discrete places of interest  an important early stage  of such processing the the ability to select represent and  find a discrete set of places of interest or landmarks that will make  up a map  associated problems are those of using an map to accurately localize  a mobile robot and generating intelligent exploration plans to  verify and elaborate a map  click here for a compressed

dudek   as a sensorbased mobile robot explores an unknown environment it  collects percepts about the world it is in  these percepts  may be ambiguous individually but as a collection they  provide strong constraints on the topology of the environment  appropriate exploration strategies and representations allow  a limited set of possible world models to be considered as  maps of the environment  the structure of the real world and the  exploration method used specify the reliability  the final map and the computational and perceptual complexity  of constructing it  computational tools being used to construct a  map from uncertain data range from graphtheoretic to  connectionist        human object recognition and shape integration    gregory dudek  daniel bub neurolinguistics montreal

instantiation of a mobile robotic system  will be able to reason about tasks recognize objects in its environment  map its environment understand voice commands and navigate through the  environment and perform the specified search tasks this will be achieved  in a dynamic environment in that knowledge of a possibly changing world  may be updated and the tasks themselves may be radically altered

behavioral architecture  for mobile robot navigation    j zelek m d levine   the intention of this study is to design an architecture that  allows  the behavioral control strategy that is flexible generalizable and  extendable  the component dedicated to  behavioral activities should be able  to  attempt tasks with or without a reasoning module  we are investigating 2d  navigational tasks for a mobile robot possessing sonar sensors and a  controllable tv camera mounted on a pantilt head  the major aspects  of our proposed behavioral architecture are as follows   a natural language lexicon is used to represent spatial information  and for defining task commands the lexicon is used as a language for  internal communications and userspecified commands the task is to go to  a location in space either known or determined by locating a specific object   an extension of a formalism referred to as teleoreactive tr programs  nilsson94 is used for specifying behavioral control  the extensions of this approach involve dealing with realtime resource  limitations and constraints             some other outside information sources      there is an archive for several general   cim
