prototyping of mechanical assemblies                       current generation cad systems provide little support for prototyping mechanical assemblies  we are creating an integrated design and simulation system to address this problem  fundamental to the effort is the investigation of effective mechanisms for allowing a designer to interact with an assembly of parts in a virtual manner prior to creation of any physical prototypes  the designer will be able to touch hold and move models of parts and assemblies as well as see them in rendered views  the result will be an environment in which part interactions can be considered in a more natural manner than is possible with current technology  part interactions and articulations of high dof assemblies can be considered early in the design process  assembly procedures can be evaluated at the time when parts are designed without the need to explicitly specify assembly sequences or constraints  even greater advantages will accrue in the design of devices intended for human use since manipulability can be examined without the need to fabricate a physical prototype  finally the virtual display tools that are integral to this project will give designers a better appreciation for complex part geometry than can be gained from traditional cad displays which have only limited 3d information          faculty       john m

thomas thompson            cad systems for all but the simplest of mechanical parts must be able to provide the designer with a clear sense of threedimensional object geometry  usually this is done with standard graphical rendering techniques involving perspective shading and simple animation  when such tools are used for assemblies of parts we often hear designers complain  what i really want to do is get my hands on the parts and see how they fit together  in fact what is happening is that the conventional display technologies are not providing the user with sufficient information about the geometry and manipulability of the objects in question      a key aspect of addressing this limitation is to augment visual rendering of geometric models with haptic interfaces which allow direct manipulation of modeled objects  such interfaces must include accurate anthropomorphic geometry and provide realistic force feedback if they are to be of real value  the sarcos dextrous arm master represents arguably the most advanced forcereflecting exoskeleton available today  the upper seven degreeoffreedom arm component matches the redundancy of the human arm while three degrees of freedom are provided to the hand in total there are 10 degrees of freedom and of force reflection per master arm  in the hand there is a two degreeoffreedom thumb a fixed forefinger and a one degreeoffreedom flexing indexmiddle finger  the sarcos dextrous arm is based on hydraulic actuation which is unmatched for torque density and bandwidth for this application  the result is a master that is much more compact and of higher performance than would be possible with electric motor drives                   the pictures above shows a one third scale model for a novel diesel engine with one cylinder two pistons and four crankshafts and represents of the kinds of assemblies that we are working towards accommodating in a virtual prototyping system  the engine involves complex and interrelated part motions that should be well understood by designers prior to committing to expensive fabrication operations  a fullfunction virtual prototyping system will let the designer manipulate individual parts to see how the entire assembly moves virtual prototyping furthermore would allow a designer to consider possible assembly sequences modifying parts as necessary to ease the assembly process  finally a virtual prototyping system with a sufficiently complete model of the human body could be used to validate assembly operations for the engine      creating a user interface for virtual prototyping systems involves solving three largely independent problems    visual rendering involves creating realistic views of a configuration of parts  there are two aspects to haptic rendering  the first involves giving the user a realistic sensation that he or she is actually touching and manipulating physical objects  the second takes motions made by a user and modifies the models specifying the virtual world appropriately   contact and interference computations are needed to determine parttopart and usertopart interactions in the virtual world  visual rendering haptic rendering and contact and interference detection must all exploit knowledge about the nature of mechanical assemblies since general solutions are not likely to be viable   geometric modeling systems able to support virtual prototyping of mechanical assemblies need capabilities beyond those of the typical cadcam system  not only must it be possible to design and render individual parts but part interactions involving contact forces and torques must be computable in realtime  when a designer reaches out to grab a virtual part the system needs to know when contact with the part has been made so that appropriate feedback can be generated  once a solid grip has been established user feedback must reflect object inertial and gravity forces and assembly forces due to contact  for those assemblies capable of articulation a manipulation of one part of the assembly must both cause the appropriate motions in other parts of the assembly and reflect appropriate sensations to the user                standard cad systems are unable to supply much of the information needed to support either assembly operations themselves or the haptic rendering required in a virtual prototyping system
