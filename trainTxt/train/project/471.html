applications including hardware and software cad  systems persistent programming languages geographic information  systems satellite data repositories and multimedia applications  shore expands on the basic capabilities of the widelyused  exodus  storage manager developed at wisconsin funded by   arpa  in a number of  ways including support for typed objects multiple programming  languages a unixlike hierarchical name space for named objects and  a unixcompatible interface to objects with a text field this  interface is intended to ease the transition of applications from the  unix file system environment to shore as existing unix tools such as vi  and cc will be able to store their data in shore objects without  modification basically a unix file becomes either a single shore  object or the text field of a more complex object        overview    shore is something of a hybrid system by nature inheriting  characteristics both from objectoriented database systems and from  file systems  this section briefly describe the basic features of  shore  the paper    shoring up persistent applications  describes shore in much greater detail    shore has three major goals    scalability  support for hardware and language heterogeneity  support for existing filebased applications      when the shore project began 3 years ago these goals were unique  among the research and commercial oodbms community  while the   odmg effort   has also concentrated on providing some degree of support for language  heterogeneity which in turn facilitates hardware heterogeneity  shore remains distinguished by its focus on scalability and support  for applications that depend on the unix file system for persistent  storage  furthermore since the shore data model sdl is basically    compatible with the odmg data model odl  we expect that much of the technology that we develop can eventually be  transferred to the commercial sector    scalable architecture  shores software architecture is unique is several ways  first shore uses a symmetric peertopeer distributed  architecture  in shore every participating processor runs a  shore server process whether or not the processor has shore data disks  attached  the software has been designed to be scalable  it can run on a single processor a network of workstations or  a large parallel processor such as the intel paragon or ibm sp12  this design is in contrast to the clientserver architecture  used by exodus and all the oodbms vendors  while a clientserver  architecture is fine for a design environment such as is typically  used in software and hardware cad efforts it is not scalable      the second unique feature of the shore architecture is its notion  of a valueadded server  by structuring the software that runs  in the server with extensibility in mind it is relatively simple for  users to build applicationspecific servers  for example the    paradise project   is already using the shore server to build a geographic information system for   nasas  eosdis project        we feel that these two unique pieces of technology will play a  important role in a variety of future research and commercial endeavors  for example the digital libraries of the future will almost certainly  depend on the availability of scalable persistent object technology  such systems are going to store retrieve manipulate and transmit  objects containing video and pictures as well as text  while  current oodbms products could be used these systems are oriented  toward dealing with gigabytes and not terabytes of data  customizability is equally important  the indexing retrieval  and query processing mechanisms needed for a digital library  are very different from those required for a geographic information  system    language and hardware heterogeneity    objects in shore are typed  shore provides a single languageneutral  type system that is used to define the types of all shore objects  this type system is embodied in the shore data language sdl  which is the language in which shore object types are defined  sdl enhances the omg data model idl with support for database  features such as bulk types eg sets and lists and persistence  the provision of typed persistent objects simplifies the task of  supporting heterogeneous hardware environments and makes it feasible  to support access to persistent objects from multiple programming  languages which is a key objective of the shore project  as mentioned earlier sdl is quite closely related to odl  the languageneutral object type definition language that was  recently proposed as a standard by the oodb vendor consortium odmg  in terms of its emphasis however odmg has largely concentrated on  providing a standardized interface to existing c oriented oodbs  our focus is on support for interlanguage object sharing within  a large namespace of objects    support for existing filebased applications    a major goal of shore is to enable applications that currently  use untyped byteoriented files for their persistent data  flattening and unflattening their data each time it is accessed  to stop doing so  such applications should be able to store their data as typed structured  objects for more convenient typesafe intra and interprogram data sharing  our ultimate hope is that shore will displace byteoriented  file systems such as the unix file system      shore provides two major services from a file system standpoint  first  to support object naming and space management in a world with many  persistent objects shore provides a flexible treestructured  unixlike namespace in which all persistent objects are reachable  either directly or indirectly  doing so gives shore users  a familiar framework in which to register individual  persistent objects termed registered objects the roots of  large persistent data structures or bulk sets of unnamed objects termed  anonymous objects  the realization of this framework involves  several different kinds of shore file system objects including  directories pools which are files containing anonymous objects  symbolic links and cross references      shore provides two mechanisms to ease the transition of legacy unix  applications such as compilers editors and cad systems from  traditional bytestream files to shore  first for applications that can be relinked shore provides a standard  unixcompatible file system interface  eg open close read  write mkdir chdir  in order to make access to shore objects via unix file system calls  possible the definer of a shore object type can optionally designate one  variablelength byte string or character string attribute of the object as  being the objects unix data  programs that attempt to read an object  through shore counterparts of the unix file system calls  will only see this portion of the object for legacy programs that  wish to do so without being relinked it is possible to nfsmount a  shore file system and access the unix data  contained in its objects directly  this makes it feasible for both  new and old applications to access the same set of objects  while old applications can only access the unix data component  of the object new applications can define and access other more  structured attributes of the object          release information    below is the latest time table

models  hence sdl and odl  are very similar to one another  once odl stabilizes  we can convert sdl to be 100 compatible with odl
