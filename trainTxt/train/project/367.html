application of multidisciplinary design optimization mdo to a diverse class of system design problems mdo is based upon the philosophy of identifying the appropriate combination of parameters which are under the control of a designer or design team and which will result in the most effective product or system for all practical aerospace systems the design of a systems is a complex sequence of events which integrates the activities of a variety of discipline experts and their associated tools the development archiving and exchange of information between these individual experts is central to the design task  it is this information which provides the basis for these experts to make their design decisions  resulting in the final product            the development of mdo has been inextricably tied to developments in computer hardware and software advanced analysis tools such as computational fluid dynamics cfd and finite element analysis fea have now been integrated into the daily activities of many designers however design decisions are often based on a variety of information sources analytic numerical simulation design heuristic or even intuition the development and integration of this information using high powered computing tools has begun to demonstrate the true potential of mdo           a variety of methods and applications are being considered in each case the fundamental approach is to provide the individual discipline expert with the information necessary to evaluate the system as a whole and to be able to understand the impact of individual decisions on the overall system design the methods being considered include extensions to global sensitivity equations gse the application of artificial neural networks for design space mapping and the integration of distributed computing and process scheduling into the mdo environment          the current research effort is a joint program between the departments of   aerospace and mechanical engineering  and the   computer science and engineering   departments at the university of notre dame the coordination of efforts within the project is based upon identification of a series of   demonstration problems  the formulation of a number of   mdo algorithms  and specific   design tool development   test problem and algorithm development provide a focus for the efforts of each of these individual researchers these problems are being selected so that they represent a diverse spectrum of mdo applications and will present a variety of challenges for the methods being developed and evaluated as part of this research program as this three year program continues information related to each of the primary phases of the project will be added to this document the results of those issues identified as   future efforts   will be used to assess applicability of the   mdo tools    to a wide variety of applications a number of references are available which outline various developments associated with this research program     the annual report which summarizes the research activities from october 1994 to october 1995 can be accessed and the slides used for the annual presentation at nasa langley research center on october 16 1995 are being processed for posting on this web site     the following are a selection of recent publications developed as part of this research program many are attached as postscipt files and if you have a postscript viewer they should be accessible for review and copying if you are unable to access any of these papers and are
