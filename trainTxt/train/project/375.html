information theory and information retrieval      graduate students  n leung and s lawson     professors j t coffey and s sechrest         this project examines the fundamental limits of efficient  contextbased retrieval in large scale databases such as  those used in scientific and medical databases  the nature  and quantity of the data involved in these applications  demand new approaches and it is the goal of this project to  investigate the role that the methods of information theory  can play in this task  based on a number of simplified  abstract models we have derived results that demonstrate  that expected access time can be greatly reduced in general  by adding redundancy to the database  the general problem  involves a number of interesting variants of classical  problems in source and channel coding and multiuser  information theory      in developing theoretical results in this research we are  aiming to acquire insight that will be used to provide  firstorder guidance in system design further guidance will  be found by comparisons with results arrived at through more  detailed simulation of systems  the applicability and  robustness of our results and others are being investigated  actual datasets and realistic workloads can be used to  validate our models and assess the applicability of our  results to physical systems         maximum likelihood sequence estimation for asynchronous data  communications      graduate student i sharfer     professor  a o hero         we are developing techniques for maximum likelihood sequence  estimation for asynchronous multiple access communications  with coherent spatial diversity using a receiver antenna  array  this project involves aspects of estimation theory  and lower bound analysis iterative implementations of  maximum likelihood viterbi and em algorithms multiple  access communications and antenna array processing maximum  likelihood beamforming direction finding power  estimation  we have obtained a nontrivial extension of  the snydergeorghiades sequqnce estimation algorithm to the  array receiever which includes spread spectrum modulation  and the effects of rayleigh fading  this has been achieved  using an iterative maximum likelihood algorithm based on a  generalization called space alternating generalized em  sage of the expectationmaximization em algorithm which  was recently developed by fesslerhero for problems in  tomographic reconstruction  the resulting sagetype  sequence estimation algorithm yields maximum likelihood  estimates which are of much lower complexity than  snydergeorghiades involve no approximations and are  easily generalizable to multipath and doppler shift common  in mobile radio communications           research papers of prof d l

national science foundation         vector quantization is increasingly being used as a lossy  data compression technique for sources such as speech  images and video  practical vector quantizers structure  their codebooks to simplify encoding and decoding  for  example block transform celp treestructured twostage  lattice quadtree product pyramid and finitestate vector  quantizers are common techniques listed roughly in  decreasing order of structure  although structure generally  has an adverse effect on ratedistortion performance it  permits the use of quantizers with larger dimensions which  usually results in much better performance for a given  complexity  until now there has been little theory to  explain the complexity performance tradeoff of structured  vector quantizers        this project is developing new methods for analyzing  structured vector quantizers  one is an extension of  bennetts integral to vector quantizers  it shows how the  meansquared error depends on the distribution and shape of  quantization cells  another is an asymptotic formula for  the probability density of the quantization error  these  new methods have lead to the successful analysis of several  structured vector quantizers including treestructured and  twostage quantizers  still another is the analysis of  transform coders at very low rates      the insight gained from this analysis has also led to a new  form of twostage quantization called cellconditioned  multistage vq that has the same low complexity advantages  of traditional multistage quantization but asymptotically  suffers no loss in performance relative to unstructured  quantization  it has also lead to new high performance low  complexity methods for converting entropy coders into  fixedrate coders           modelbased digital image halftoning      professor  d l neuhoff      new modelbased approaches to halftoning are being  developed  they use wellknown models of visual perception  along with models of printing that we have developed  one  approach minimizes the meansquared error between the  perceived intensity of the continuoustone image and the  perceived intensity of the printed halftoned image  another  is an adaptation of the wellknown error diffusion method to  include the printer model  traditional approaches for  example ordered clustered dither obtain robustness to  printer distortions such as ink spreading at the expense  of spatial resolution and the visibility of graininess  in  contrast our new methods exploit the printer distortions to  produce higher quality images than would be obtained with  rperfects printers  improvements due to modelbased  halftoning are expected to reduce the resolution  requirements for laser printers used in highquality  printing eg 400 dotsinch instead of 600 modelbased  halftoning can be especially useful in transmission of  highquality documents using highfidelity grayscale image  encoders  in such cases halftoning is performed at the  receiver just before printing  apart from coding  efficiency this approach permits the halftoner to be tuned  to the individual printer whose characteristics may vary  considerably from those of other printers for example  writeblack vs writewhite laser printers         image coding      gracuate students  m horowitz m slyz     professor  d l neuhoff      image coding is the process of creating binary image  representations with the dual goals of efficiency as few  bits as possible in the representation and accuracy the  reproduced images shall be as similar as possible to the  original  two approaches are being pursued  the first  involves the use of a detailed model of the intermediate  level human visual sensors to construct transform codes that  hide quantization noise  the second involves the design of  lossless image codes based on adaptive prediction with new  kinds of predictors and adaptation strategies  these  lossless image codes are intended for applications such as  medical imaging where an exact reproduction of the image is  required  on the other hand the first project is intended  for more everyday applications where exact reproduction is  not necessary but good quality and high efficiency are  needed          performance and complexity of cdma networks with  codedmodulation      graduate students  m klimesh w sung     professors  w stark and j t coffey     sponsors  national science foundation         there are two parts of this research project  the first part deals  with decoding algorithms for worst case interference  in  this work we have derived transmission and decoding  strategies that allows for maximum information transmission  or minimum error probability  these strategies allow the  transmitter to vary the transmission power pseudorandomly  the performance of a maximum likelihood decoding algorithm  against the worst case jammer can be improved  worst case  interference is derived as well as the resulting  performance      the second part involves developing novel decoders and  demodulators that achieve favorable tradeoffs of complexity  versus performance within this area a number of current  topics are being investigated such as the design of minimal  trellises for block codes fundamental limits for decoders  with a reduced number of states decoding algorithms for  timevarying channels and so on         spreadspectrum in faded channels      graduate students  d goeckel and v chang     professor  w stark      in this project we are examining the performance of  spreadspectrum systems in a faded channel  the type of  fading is such that in one spreadspectrum system with a  relatively small bandwidth the fading appears to be  nonselective in frequency  in another spreadspectrum  system the fading is frequency selective  the goal is to  examine the performance of a directsequence spreadspectrum  system operating in the presence of multipath fading with  error control coding  the important issues are the channels  memory the selectivity of the channel the synchronization  algorithm and the decoding approach  these are issues that  are not very well understood by system designers presently  our preliminary results indicate that for a nonselective  channel larger spreading improves performance in spite of  the fact that more of the received energy is treated as  interference rather than part of a faded signal  in other  words as the bandwidth increases the multipath channel  becomes more resolveable and signals that were unresolved  before can be resolved and rejected by the processing gain  of the spreadspectrum system         communicating over power lines      graduate student  yp wang     professor  w stark      the goal of this research is to investigate different  alternatives for transmitting data over a power line  the  power line suffers from distortion because of the nonideal  characteristics of the media  this comes in two forms  the  first is due to the attenuation varying as a function of  frequency  the second form is multipath due to reflections  off of mismatched lines transmitting data over power lines  using spreadspectrum techniques can mitigate the distortion  present in the channel  we are investigating different  modulation and coding schemes with spreadspectrum for  transmitting data over the power line         optical communications and very noisy channels      graduate student  s lee     professor  k a winick      a very noisy channel is a channel whose capacity is close to  zero  very noisy channels vncs can be used to model many  physical channels operating at low signaltonoise ratios  more importantly a large class of physical channels  operating at arbitrary signaltonoise ratios can be  modeled as repeated uses of a vnc  in particular this is  true for the infinite bandwidth additive white gaussian  noise channel and the direct detection optical poisson  channel  the error exponent indicates the best achievable  performance of  any block codes used over a communications  channel  a code which achieves this best performance is  said to be exponentially optimum   for most channels the  error exponent is not known and can only be bounded  in  this research the error exponent is computed exactly for a  large class of vncs and exponentially optimum codes are  explicitly constructed for these channels  these ideas are  applied to derive both the error exponent and exponentially  optimum codes for the direct detection  polarizationswitched optical channel         distance bounds for runlengthconstrained codes      graduate student  sh yang     professor  k  a winick      one of the most basic problems in coding theory is to find  the largest code of a given length and minimum distance  there are several known upper and lower bounds when the  codewords are unconstrained  in many digital transmission  and recording systems considerations such as spectral  shaping selfclocking and reduction of intersymbol  interference require that the recorded sequences satisfy  special runlength constraints  in this research distance  bounds and the construction of runlengthconstrained  errorcorrecting codes are investigated  upper bounds are  derived for the minimum achievable distance of  runlengthconstrained sequences and lower bounds are also  derived which include cost constraints          runlengthconstrained writeonce memories      graduate student  sh yang     professor  k a winick     sponsors  office of naval research office of naval  technology         a writeonce memory wom is a storage medium where the  value in each bit location can only be changed from the  virgin 0state to the permanent 1state irreversibly  data  can be recorded by marking blank ie 0state  bits  those marked locations are stuck in the 1state and hence  limit to some degree further use of the memory  examples of  woms in the electronic and computer industry are punch  cards paper tapes proms and optical disks  current  laseroptics technology produces the writeonce cdroms  that are especially sutiable for storing archival data  usually this data must be periodically updated after it has  been initially recorded  if we can reuse the writeonce  disk by implementing an efficient coding scheme then the  expense of replacing the whole disk may be saved  in this  research the ultimate capacity of runlengthconstrained  writeonce memories is investigated using techniques from  information theory         corrugated waveguide filters      graduate students  c brooks and g vossler     professor  k  a winick     sponsor  national science foundation          corrugated thin film waveguides play a major role in  lightwave devices  applications include distributed  feedback lasing bistable switching phase matching in  nonlinear materials pulse compression grating coupling  and optical filtering  in many of these applications the  corrugation is periodic  in an aperiodically corrugated  thin film waveguide however the frequency dependent  coupling between waveguide modes can be used to produce a  filter which has a specified spectral response  inverse  scattering techniques have been developed for designing such  filters and  efforts are currently underway to fabricate  these devices  several new fabrication techniques are being  pursued  these include an optical direct write method  based on photobleaching gamma rayinduced defect centers in  ionexchangeable glasses and a rbent waveguides approach  the first filter to be demonstrated will compensate for  dispersioninduced pulse spreading in optical fibers         rare earthdoped waveguide lasers      graduate students  g vossler and c brooks     professor  k  a winick     sponsors  national science foundation  nsf center for ultrafast optical science  smith industries  imra america inc         recently the development of rare earthdoped fiber lasers  has received considerable attention  these fiber lasers  exhibit a host of desirable properties  first they permit  wide tuning ranges and short pulse generation because of  their broad emission lines  second the pump powers required  for lasing are low since the pump beam is strongly confined  to a small volume  finally rare earthdoped lasers offer  better frequency stability longer lifetimes and less  temperature sensitivity than semiconductor devices  these  traits make them promising devices for telecommunications  sensing and spectroscopic applications  glass waveguide  lasers on planar substrates are a natural extension of the  fiber technology  as opposed to a fiber it should be  possible to integrate monolithically multiple components  onto a single glass substrate  these components could  include distributed feedback laser mirrors grating  couplers modelockers and nonlinear elements  we have  fabricated neodymiumdoped channel waveguide lasers in  special glass melts and have demonstrated the first glass  integrated optic distributed bragg reflector laser  efforts  are currently under way to passively modelock these lasers  and  to extend theses results to rare earthdoped lithium  niobate hosts  novel sensors based on this technology are  also under development         return to  um  eecs systems division  homepage
