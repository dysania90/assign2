example seq data model  sequin  query language optimization techniques seq system development publications related work contact information     project objectives   a number of important database applications require the processing of large amounts of ordered  sequence  data the domains of these applications include financial management historical analysis economic and social sciences metereology medical sciences and biological sciences existing relational databases are inadequate in  this regard data collections are treated as sets not sequences  consequently expressing sequence queries is tedious and evaluating  them is inefficient     databases should   model the data using the abstraction of  sequences  allow data sequences to be queried in a  declarative manner  utilizing the ordered semantics take advantage of the unique opportunities available for query  optimization and evaluation integrate sequence data with relational data so that users can store and query a combination of relation and sequences  these requirements serve as the goals of the seq project various kinds of sequences need to be supported temporal sequences being the most important kind queries should be expressible using notions like next and previous which are natural when considering sequences these queries should be optimized so that they can be evaluated efficiently these issues need to be studied in theory and then a database system needs  to be built that demonstrates the feasibility of the theoretical ideas      project status   the current status of the project is  we have defined the  seq  data model that can support  most important kinds of sequence data we have also defined algebraic query operators that can be composed to form sequence queries analogous to the composition of relational algebra operators to form relation queries we have described how sequence queries can be efficiently processed and have identified various optimization techniques we use a sequence query language  sequin  that can declaratively express queries over sequences a  sequin  query can include embedded expressions in a relational query language like sql or viceversa we are building a diskbased database system to demonstrate the  feasibility of our proposals the system implements the  seq   model using a nested complex object architecture it is built over the  shore storage manager and can process several megabytes of data relations and sequences are supported in an integrated and extensible  manner      motivating example of a sequence query      a weather monitoring system records information about various meteorological  phenomena there is a sequentiality in the occurrence of these phenomena the  various meteorological events are sequenced by the time at which they are  recorded a scientist asks the query       for which volcano eruptions did the most recent earthquake have a strength greater than 70 on the richter  scale     if this query is to be expressed in a relational query language like sql  complex features like groupby clauses correlated subqueries and aggregate functions are required further a conventional relational query optimizer  would not find an efficient query execution plan even given the knowledge  that the earthquakes and volcano relations are sorted by time    however a very efficient plan exists if one models the data as sequences ordered by time the two sequences can be scanned in lock step  similar to a sort merge join the most recent earthquake record scanned  can be stored in a temporary buffer whenever a volcano record is  processed the value of the most recent earthquake record stored in the  buffer is checked to see if its strength was greater than 70 possibly  generating an answer this query can therefore be processed with a single  scan of the two sequences and using very little memory the key to such  optimization is the sequentiality of the data and the query      data model   the details of the  seq  data model are described in a published paper click here  for postscript version here we present the gist of it  the basic model of a sequence is a set of records mapped to an ordered domain of positions this manytomany relationship between records and positions can be viewed in two dual but distinct ways as a set of records mapped to each position or as a set of positions mapped to each record these two views are called positional and recordoriented respectively and each gives rise to a set of query operators based on that view queries on sequences could require operators of either or both flavors  the recordoriented operators are similar to relational operators and include various kinds of joins overlap containment etc and aggregates such operators have been extensively explored by researchers in the temporal database community        the positional operators include next previous offset moving aggregates etc  further operators allow zooming operations on  sequences by means of collapsing and expanding the ordering domains  associated with the sequence for instance a daily sequence could be  zoomed out iecollapsed to a weekly sequence or zoomed in  ie expanded to an hourly sequence   the last part of the model deals with operations on groups ie sets of  sequences the advantage is that this makes it easy to model queries  involving sequence collections which is the case in many realworld situations all the sequence operators are extended to work with groups  of similar sequences instead of with single sequences this extension of the seq model indicates that a practical implementation of seq would probably involve a nested complex object system      sequin  query language   we have devised a query language called  sequin  using which declarative sequence queries can be specified the language is similar in flavor to sql except that the inputs to queries as well as the results of queries are sequences click   here  for a description of the  sequin  language with examples     optimization techniques   we have proposed new optimization techniques for sequence queries  involving positional operators there are existing techniques that have been proposed for queries with recordoriented operators our optimizations use query transformations metadata and caching of  intermediate results to efficiently evaluate a query an optimal query  evaluation plan can be generated using an algorithm that relies on cost  estimates one of the important observations is that accessing sequence data  in a single stream is probably very efficient and evaluation strategies  should take this into account    the details of the optimization techniques are described in a published paper click here  for postscript version     system development   the seq database system has a clientserver architecture supporting multiple clients via a multithreaded server the server is built on top of the shore   storage manager both  sequin  and a subset of sql are supported as query languages which can be embedded inside each other the data model is a nested complex object model that allows arbitrary levels of nesting of relations inside sequences and vice versa the system is also extensible providing support for new data types new ordering domains userdefined functions  new storage implementations and new query languages for more details on the seq
