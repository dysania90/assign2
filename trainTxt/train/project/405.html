there have been   21579 accesses to this library  count updated 111396 at 021244      the darpaito progress report for the project a scalable   library for numerical linear algebra for fiscal year 19951996 is  available for viewing      click here to see  the  supercomputing96  scalapack poster                          the scalapack project is a collaborative effort between    oak ridge national laboratory  rice university  university of california berkeley  university of california los angeles  university of illinois  university of tennessee knoxville        the scalapack project is made up of 4 components    dense matrix software scalapack  large sparse eigenvalue software parpack  sparse direct systems software capss  preconditioners for large sparse iterative solvers parpre        scalapack  version 14 includes routines for the solution of dense  band and tridiagonal linear systems of equations condition estimation and  iterative refinement for lu and cholesky factorization matrix inversion  fullrank linear least squares problems orthogonal and generalized orthogonal  factorizations orthogonal transformation routines reductions to upper  hessenberg bidiagonal and tridiagonal form reduction of a symmetricdefinite  hermitiandefinite generalized eigenproblem to standard form the  symmetrichermitian generalized symmetrichermitian and the nonsymmetric  eigenproblem      software is available in single precision real double precision real  single precision complex and double precision complex  the software has  been written to be portable across a wide range of distributedmemory  environments such as the cray t3 ibm sp intel series tm cm5  clusters of workstations and any system for which   pvm  or mpi is available      a draft of the  scalapack users guide and a comprehensive  installation guide is  provided as well as test suites for all scalapack  pblas and  blacs routines      future releases of   scalapack will include routines for the solution of  general banded linear systems general and symmetric positive definite  tridiagonal systems rankdeficient linear least squares problems  generalized linear least squares problems and the singular value  decomposition  also available will be the fullindex pblas which will  have the majority of alignment restrictions removed as well as the  ability to operate on partial first blocks  the next release of  scalapack is slated for fall 1996      parpack parallel arpack is an extension of the arpack software  package used for solving large scale eigenvalue problems on distributed memory  parallel architectures  the message passing layers currently supported  are blacs  and mpi  serial arpack must be  retrieved and installed prior to installing parpack  all core  arpack routines  are available in single precision real double precision real single  precision complex and double precision complex  an extensive set of driver  routines are available for arpack and a subset of these are available  for parallel computation with parpack  these may be used as templates  that are easily modified to construct a problem specific parallel interface to  parpack      capss is a fully parallel package to solve a sparse linear system of  the form axb on a message passing multiprocessor the matrix a is assumed to  be symmetric positive definite and associated with a mesh in two or three  dimensions  this version has been tested on the  intel paragon and makes  possible efficient parallel solution for several right hand side vectors      parpre is  a package of parallel preconditioners for general sparse  matrices it includes classical pointblock relaxation methods  generalised block ssor preconditioners this includes ilu and domain  decomposition methods additive and multiplicative schwarz schur  complement  the communication protocol is  mpi and low level  routines from the petsc library are used but installing the complete  petsc library is not necessary      funding for this effort
