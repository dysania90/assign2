chaos research group at the university of maryland college park  has developed methods that are making it possible to produce portable   compilers  and runtime libraries to map a broad range of challenging applications  onto high performance computer architectures a major focus of this work  has been to develop techniques for irregular scientific problems ie  problems that are unstructured sparse adaptive or block structured the  group works extensively with     applications  developers in many disciplines and with parallel compiler vendors  many of the concepts first described and prototyped by this project are  making their way into high  performance fortran during the ongoing second round of language   definition  this work is also leading to the development of runtime support  metachaos   to couple runtime libraries used in data and task parallel compilers  metachaos is a central component for the common compiler runtime support  being developed by the parallel  compiler runtime consortium      we are currently developing techniques that will allow parallel compute  and data objects to offer their services to remotely connected clients  the goal is to develop techniques that will make it possible to compose  programs running on any combination of distributed memory shared memory  or networked microcomputers or workstations we are motivating this research  by software interoperability scenarios associated with two classes of   applications  the first class is sensor data processing and integration and the second  is complex physical simulations we have developed early prototypes of  our data parallel program coupling software and have employed our prototype  to demonstrate the ability to couple separately executing high performance  fortran programs and to couple high performance fortran programs with  applications developed using the maryland chaos and multiblock parti   libraries      based upon our experiences in developing runtime libraries and   parallelizing  applications we have developed several compilation  techniques our goal is to be able to automate our hand   parallelizationoptimization  techniques through the use of compilers we have employed the fortrand  compilation system developed primarily at rice university as the  infrastructure for implementation of our techniques      for generating efficient code from applications having multiple levels  of indirection we have developed an index flattening technique based  upon the notion of program slicing this technique transforms a loop having  multiple levels of indirection into a series of loops having at most a  single level of indirection we have also observed that aggressive   interprocedural  optimizations are required to deal with large applications that have   irregular  accesses to data or large io requirements we have developed an   interprocedural  partial redundancy elimination ipre technique for performing   interprocedural  placement of communication preprocessing and collective communication   statements  we are currently working on interprocedural balanced code placement ibcp  which will allow us to overlap computation and communication across procedure  boundaries we are also working on generating distributed memory code from  fortran90 codes that use pointers and recursive data structures by joel  saltz    chaosparti
