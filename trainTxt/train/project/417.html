with pointers to subsequent work raw data reader comments  and other material appropriate for an addendum   a list of current online reports or addenda are given first         online reports and addenda   in many cases technical reports and electronic addenda of published work  will be placed on line here in both postscript  and html format though not necessarily at the same time  your comments are welcome in certain of these cases  should you email comments regarding   related literature suggestions for experimental or theoretical   improvements alternative viewpoints then your comments if reasonable  and informative they will be linked to the html version of the technical   report or addendum and under a separate list of comments  unless  you state that you do not want this to be done i may also  link responses to your comments but not before getting your feedback  on a response         comments on purely style issues are welcome but they probably will not   be linked in others who view the technical report will be free   to view your comments as well if your comments inform a revision   of the report eg for publication then i will acknowledge them   as a personal communication or otherwise cite the literature that   you relate if i deem it relevant if your comments are online and   linked to a report then you agree to allow others to cite   them as personal communication as well again unless you state  that your comments should not be linked        the following is a list of technical report titles addenda etc  that are currently  online these are links
