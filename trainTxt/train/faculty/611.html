medium   smooth roast is best for me  fine coffee should be savored   and certainly no fake powdered milk should be used in it  the   cafe san vip sanyo coffeemaker in my office has a builtin   grinder that auto grinds and then drips the coffee    unfortunately like the intel 432 this machine   was too complex  thus the vender has discontinued production   of the machine i am currently searching for a machine of equivalent  functionality for the day my one remaining machine dies          return to faculty  home page
