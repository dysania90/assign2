morgan  kaufmann 91 coeditor of readings in planning morgan kaufmann 90  fellow of the aaai      james allens research interests span a range of issues covering  natural language understanding discourse knowledge representation  commonsense reasoning and planning these areas of research are  combined in the trains project a long term effort codirected with  len schubert the trains system is an intelligent planning assistant  that can converse in spoken natural language with a person to create  discuss and evaluate various plans involving freight shipments by  train in particular allens research breaks down into two main  subareas broadly classified as research in discourse and research in  plan reasoning      the research in discourse is focused on twoperson extended dialogs  in which the speakers have specific tasks to accomplish an emphasis  in this work is the representation and use of the context of the  dialog to solve problems in semantic interpretations and the  recognition of the intentions underlying the speakers utterances  work in this area has included developing the first computational  model of speech acts the development of a multilevel planbased  analysis involving discourselevel plans as well as domainlevel  plans and the development of several different discourseplan  recognition algorithms in addition we are exploring how prosody and  intonation signals discourse intentions and how this interacts with  the planbased dialog model while it is important for work to be  formally welldefined and understood it is equally important that  computational theories can lead to effective implementations as a  result a considerable amount of effort has also been made in  developing an expressive hybrid knowledge representation system that  can support complex reasoning about plans and actions      the research in plan reasoning draws much of its motivation from the  dialog work in particular the representation of plans must support a  wide range of different forms of reasoning plan construction ie  traditional planning plan recognition plan evaluation and the  communication of plans between agents much of our work in this area  has focused on the representation of time and action and we have  reformulated the planning problem as a problem in temporal reasoning  within this framework we have developed a representation of plans  that is temporally explicit and supports plan construction  recognition and communication we are also exploring methods of  temporal reasoning that are viable even with large data sets of  temporal information      key publications on temporal reasoning     allen jf maintaining knowledge about temporal intervals       communications of the acm 26 11 832843 november 1983   allen jf a general
