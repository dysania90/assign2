the health care setting with  j karshmer   go to  top of page     current experimental efforts  we are currently conducting experiments involving the use of graphical user interfaces guis by nonsighted computer users we have developed two test environments that allow the nonsighted user to navigate through complex menu structures and the visual desktop with the aid of musical tones and synthesized voice  the test environments currently run on macs in the cs departments labs we are always looking for volunteers to test the intefaces concepts   navigating hierarchical menu structures using tonal clues navigating the  desktop using sound and voice using  pdas in the health care setting   if you are interested in participating in any of the experiments please click here to send me
