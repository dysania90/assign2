thompson     professor of computer science        university of utah                      william b thompson    department of computer science    3190 merrill engineering building    university of

current areas of interest and research    professor thompsons primary research interest is in the area of  computer vision with an emphasis on problems involving the  determination of shape and spatial organization for tasks in robotics                 sensing strategies for           advanced manufacturing         building on utahs experience in cagd computer aided    geometric design for manufacturing we are investigating    novel sensing strategies specifically suited to manmade    objects  current work is addressing the reverse engineering    of machined parts based on an approach centering around    highlevel manufacturing features rather than lowlevel    geometry             benchmarking of iu    for manufacturing         we are developing a novel approach to providing test data for    image understanding  all of the objects making up the test    set will be designed and fabricated inhouse  this gives us    ground truth from the original design data control over    variablility and the ability to distribute actual parts with    sensed data               rapid virtual prototyping of assemblies         immersive interfaces to cad systems can allow a designer to    experiment with assemblies of parts without the need to    construct and modify physical prototypes  in this effort we    are constructing a haptic interface so that a designer will be    able to touch hold and move models of parts and assemblies    as well as see them in rendered views  the result will be an    environment in which part interactions can be considered in a    more natural manner than is possible with current technology                visionbased    navigation in unstructured outdoor terrain         we are developing a model of the process by which current    location can be determined from views of outdoor environments    and maps representing topographic information  an    interdisciplinary approach is used involving laboratory and    field studies of highly expert map readers computational    analysis and computer simulations                         visual motion         this project focuses on the analysis of visual motion    including optical flow estimation in the presence of    discontinuities extracting shape properties in a qualitative    manner that avoids much of the complexity and noise    sensitivity of tranditional structurefrommotion methods and    detecting moving objects in the environment when the sensor    might also be moving             professor thompson is currently on the advisory board of the ieee  transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence  and  previously served as an associate editor of that journal  he joined  the university of utah in 1991 after 16 years in the computer science  department
