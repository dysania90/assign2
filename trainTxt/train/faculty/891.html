jhayeseecsumichedu              background      john p hayes has been a professor of  eecs  at  the  university of michigan  since  1982 prior to that he was on the faculty of the university of southern  california los angeles  he teaches and conducts research in the areas of  computeraided design and testing of digital systems computer architecture  vlsi design and faulttolerant computing he was the founding director of  michigans  advanced computer architecture laboratory   prof hayes is the author  of five books including computer architecture and organization  mcgrawhill  2nd ed 1988 layout minimization for cmos cells kluwer 1992 and  introduction to digital logic design addisonwesley 1993 as well as  numerous technical papers he received  the be degree from the national  university of ireland dublin  and his ms and phd degrees from the  university of illinois urbanachampaign prof hayes is a fellow of ieee and a  member of acm and sigma xi        current research      our  group  is currently conducting research on the following topics  hierarchical  testing of digital circuits builtin selftest bist design  verification faulttolerant architectures  for safetycritical applications  design with fieldprogrammable gates arrays fpgas automated layout methods  for cmos cells and  highlevel timing analysis the research is sponsored  by darpa nsf and various industrial organizations  for further information see the list of  recent publications below  also see the darpasponsored project on  hardware design verification for microprocessors
