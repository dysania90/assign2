    research interests  database management systems scientific databases user interfaces and  information visualization complex query optimization  heterogeneous databases      my research primarily focuses on two areas of database systems  optimization of complex queries and database support for scientific  data        future database applications pose several new challenges to  query optimization  the complexity of queries asked will be significantly higher than  in traditional systems  the number of alternative evaluation algorithms will be much higher  as well especially with the use of parallelism or with attempts to  optimize for several values of runtime parameters parametric query  optimization  thus the number of alternative access plan for processing a query  will be extremely large so that the currently used algorithms  for finding the optimum among them will be inadequate  my research investigates the use of randomized optimization algorithms  as a viable solution to this problem  i am primarily interested in simulated annealing and genetic algorithms  as well as other alternatives that take advantage of special properties  of query optimization  i am also looking into complex query scheduling problems especially  those that arise in parallel and multimedia environments  error propagation of size and cost estimates in complex queries are also  part of my studies where i am trying to identify the appropriate  information that must be maintained by a database system to limit the  propagation of error  to that end im primarily focusing on identifying the properties of  optimal histograms that approximate the distribution of values in  relation attributes        the computational mode of investigation is expected to be part of many  experiments in various scientific disciplines in the future  the databases to be generated need specialized support on many aspects  that current technology is not ready to provide  i am involved in the development of the it zoo desktop experiment management  environment that will help scientists throughout the life cycle of their  experimental studies  a primary component of that system will be a database system  two major issues that my work addresses are visual user interfaces and  semantic heterogeneity  in the former im concentrating on identifying what the right metaphors are  for representing complex database schemas queries and objects to scientists  so that they are natural to them and also on investigating the power of  it dynamic visual queries  in the latter im concentrating on developing visual tools that will facilitate  translation and integration of different data formats or schemas  although these issues are generic and arise in all experimental  scientific disciplines my efforts are guided by the needs of specific  projects with which i am associated in particular simulationbased  performance studies of computer systems simulationbased
