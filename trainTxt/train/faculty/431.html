basic daily functioning  this reliance demands that computer systems be built that can continue to operate even when one or more hardware modules andor software programs malfunction  a central theme of dr sullivans research is designing systems that can tolerate faults  with his colleagues dr sullivan has defined and analyzed novel probabilistic models of selfmonitoring multiprocessor systems and provided powerful diagnostic strategies for localizing and removing faults  he and prof masson have also introduced a promising software fault tolerance technique called the certification trail method  dr sullivans research interests also include the broad area of the design and analysis of algorithms eg algorithms motivated by artificial intelligence applications      click here to see selected
