usability center    mark guzdial       mark guzdial is an assistant professor in the college of computing at georgia institute of technology he received his phd in education and computer science a joint degree at the university of michigan in 1993 where he developed emile an environment for high school science learners programming multimedia demonstrations and physics simulations he is also the designer of mediatext a multimedia composition environment used in elementary and high school classrooms   mark is a member of the gvu center   the cognitive science program and   the edutech institute   mark recently coorganized a workshop with rick weingarten of computing research association for the national science foundation the charge of the workshop was to set a research agenda for computer science in educational technology  the draft report from that workshop is available online current areas of interest educational computing softwarerealized scaffolding construction and design environments for students constructionism collaboration support log file analysis and visualization computational science computer modeling simulation and visualization for students    mark guzdials current research centers on facilitating student learning through student design construction and analysis of artifacts  philosophically he is a constructivist even a constructionist but he sees a need for support to enable and facilitate a students construction of artifacts and knowledge    his goal is to provide to students similar kinds of opportunities that professional scientists and engineergs have for learning and exploring through computation  he has developed simulation environments for learning science through construction and is now exploring visualization and collaboration environments to facilitate science and engineering learning  to evaluate the usability and learnability of the environments he creates mark is developing techniques for analysis of user event traces log files   recent classes with interesting home pages   cs 2390 modeling and design winter 96  which is where webcamile was first used in cs 2390  cs 2390 modeling and design spring 96 where  stable was first used  cs 6398 design and evaluation of educational software  cs 2390 modeling and design fall 96 current research projects   nsf multimedia courseware project with john stasko and jim foley i am working on creating effective multimedia courseware for computer science courses using www   softwarerealized scaffolding and learnercentered design  the design of emile revolved around providing softwarerealization of what educators called scaffolding support which enables students to perform activities and to learn through those activities  in collaboration with elliot soloway kenneth e hay and yasmin kafai an interface design emphasis on learnercentered design is evolving part of which is softwarerealized scaffolding   camile collaborative and multimedia interactive learning environment is a new learning environment designed to support students in collaboration with multimedia annotations  camile can be seen as mediatext on a network   device dynamic environment for visualization in chemical engineering device is an environment in which chemical engineering students learn through a process of design in a simulated world  device is being developed by noel rappin the eventual goal is to merge devicelike simulation support with camilelike collaboration tools to create broadbased support for learning in chemical engineering  scope  scaffolded and contextualized programming environments for engineering education  this project is sponsored by the national science foundation   log file analyses and visualizations are used to understand the effectiveness of the supports provided in these environments   cognitive  multimedia a project with john stasko richard catrambone ashwin ram and mike byrne sponsored by onr focuses on trying to understand the most effective ways to construct interactive multimedia   generalized scaffolding stable is a first attempt at creating generalized scaffolding  not modifying the environment but providing scaffolding multiple representations generic plan libraries a la gpceditor or emile and collaborative environments in support of an existing work environment visualworks smalltalk  stable is being tested in cs 2390 during spring 96  instructions on how to create stable cases are available    research projects from the university of michigan working with elliot soloway and elliots highly interactive computing environments group mark was primarily involved in three projects at the university of michigan     gpceditor goal plan code editor is a pascal programming environment that provides explicit supports for student design   mediatext is a multimedia composition environment for grades 612 students mark designed mediatext with elliot and mediatext is now a commercial product developed by constructive instruments and distributed by apple computer and wings for learning   emile is a programming environment for science students exploring physics by creating simulations  emile was marks dissertation work  emile implements softwarerealized scaffolding which provides adaptable levels of support      copies of recent aera 95 papers are available in www formats  contact information ma rk guzdial
