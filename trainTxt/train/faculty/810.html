designed to be optimally suited for use in language engineering research and applications in order to serve as a widely accepted set of encoding standards for european corpus workthe ces specifies a minimal encoding level that corpora must achieve to be considered standardized in terms of descriptive representation marking of structural and typographic information as well as general architecture so as to be maximally suited for use in a text database  it also provides encoding specifications for linguistic annotation together with a data architecture for linguistic corpora             ces

each dtd          tagusage         this short shell script writen by heikijaan kaalep and then modified by me will do the tag usage calculations for you and and format it in so you can just paste it
