   research interests     distributed systems communication protocols conferencing and replication  currently i am building the distributed systems and communication lab at the department of computer science here at hopkins and also am affiliated with the center of excellence in space data and information sciences cesdis the goddard space flight center nasa     the main project in the distributed systems and communication lab is commedia a crossplatform  infrastrcuture for multimedia conferencing commedia will combine a  reliable multicast toolkit spread with video voice graphics and application sharing over local and wide area networks the development is done over bsdi unix and win95 we are just strating so it is not too late to join     since i received my bsc i gained vast experience in building distributed systems i spent six years building such a defense system heading a 50 manyears effort and delivering an operational solution to the customer  subsequently i spent four years researching and building ie playing with distributed systems network protocols and replicated databases and guess what i even got a phd for that   i was one of the initiators and main participants of the transis project with professor danny dolev at the hebrew university of jerusalem israel transis is a group communication tool that supports reliable multicast services over a partitioned network transis utilizes the hardware unreliable multicast where possible optimizing the performance for existing networks  i also took part in building the totem group communication protocol with professors melliarsmith and moser at the university of california santa barbara  other people i enjoy collaborating with are david breitgand gregory chockler nabil huleihel and avishai
