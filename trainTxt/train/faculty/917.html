science faculty   up computer science faculty   next  arvind k bansal     johnnie w baker    full professor         johnnie w baker is the coordinator for computer science his  research interests include parallel algorithms parallel production systems application of parallel computers in artificial intelligence parallel  computational geometry computational chemistry and parallel computer  models he has also published in the areas of banach spaces and general  topology baker received a bs degree in mathematics from hardin simmons  university in abilene texas in 1958 a ms and phd degree in mathematics  in 1965 and 1968 respectively from the university of texas in austin he  was an assistant professor at florida state university before joining the  faculty at kent state university in 1973 he is a member of acm and the  computer society of the ieee    recent research activities        a major focus of bakers recent research has been the development of a computational model for associative computing and establishing algorithms and software for this model the associative model is designed to provide a common platform for the development of appropriate algorithms and software for massively parallel computers in general and an extended version of simd computers in particular current work is underway to compare this model to other parallel models of computation including the reconfigurable mesh and the mesh with multiple broadcasts  other current research interests include  developing improved constant time algorithms requiring fewer processors  for the reconfigurable mesh embedding and emulating hypercubes on a 3d  mesh architecture and developing parallel algorithms and improved sequential  algorithms that require less memory and running time for modeling organic  compounds at the molecular level    selected masters theses over 15 total       steven talus parallel simd algorithms for the zeroone knapsack problem        1988    andrew miller a parallel

comparison of the associative model with other           models for parallel computation this study will involve studying          when one model can emulate another model and identification of
