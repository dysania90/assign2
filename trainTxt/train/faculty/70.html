spent 10 years designing real network protocols some of which are in products for decnet  however i later did my phd research in the theory of protocol design  for more details see my   vita  for recent papers click  here      my goal is to fruitfully combine my experience in distributed systems both theory and practice  my most recent work in network protocols includes the first ologlogn  algorithm for fair queuing new techniques for fragmentation and reassembly and new load balancing protocols  recent work in distributed algorithms include a result that shows that crash failures can cause almost all  asynchronous protocols to fail assuming that nodes keep no nvram across crashes and techniques for making window protocols selfstabilizing web pointers to ps files can be found below the work on distributed algorithms is supported by an onr young investigator award and a grant from nsf the work in network  protocols is supported by an nsf research initiation award     past work on network protocols includes techniques for speeding up packet processing based on adding fields to packets making hopbyhop flow control both efficient and reliable efficient fair queuing using deficit round robin and efficient timer algorithms  patents  for past work include patents for bridge protocols switch design the osi  routing update protocol and rate based flow control past work on distributed algorithms includes together with colleagues at mit and univ of texas a set of general techniques to make protocols selfstabilizing a protocol is selfstabilizing if it begins to work correctly regardless of what state the protocol starts in thus selfstabilization is an abstraction of a strong faulttolerance property   some of the techniques we have discovered for making protocols selfstabilizing  include local checking and correction local checking and global correction compiling  synchronous protocol  counter flushing and window washing     i hope that coupling these two themes distributed algorithms and network protocols theory and practice will provide a rich synergy both in terms of research and coursework for example i have taught the network protocol class for senior wash u undergraduates for three semesters and have taught them some protocol design techniques  i taught the distributed algorithms class in the spring of 95 and taught a tutorial on applying techniques from  distributed algorithms in sigcomm 95   i illustrated the theory using many  realworld protocol examples  i will teach a tutorial on efficient protocol implementation techniques in sigcomm 96        recent papers   my recent papers on both networking and selfstabilization can be obtained from the web to look at a brief description of available papers and then navigate to papers

selfstabilizing mobile networks   from fall 96 will be doing a  phd at berkeley in the mobile computing group   cs 423 documents   ill start trying to make cs 423 documents available on the web  to look at a sample midterm please click   here   course outline for cs564t  in the spring of 1995 i taught a course on concurrent message passing algorithms with emphasis on applications to network protocols the course is designed to help students learn how to design protocols and to apply them to the problems of real networks   thus we illustrate the main ideas using actual protocols from existing networks i taught an abbreviated version of that course as a tutorial in sigcomm 95    to look at a course outline for cs 564 please click   here to look at the slides for the sigcomm tutorial please click    here its in landscape format and you may have to swap landscape   the file before viewing          selfstabilization interest group     user names registered as of dec 13th
