includes the   nasa multidisciplinary design and analysis group activities   nasanova science course materials   some online papers   information about classes fall 96   java class syllabus and assignments   some possible ms and phd projects   ideas for documenting programs using literate   programming   techniques   a few of my favorite things          an evolving list of special interest journals   university homepage   university phone book    college homepage   department homepage   email stevecsclemsonedu   and a picture of one of my hobbies beauty is important    just whos is this guy check out his vitae you can find out where hes been all over where hes worked ditto some of his students a bunch and what hes interested in lots of different things wide publications   computational science and engineering professor stevenson is very active in the development of computational science and engineering at clemson and on the national scene for more information on this work see the the  clemson computational science and engineering resource homepage   the resource has many pointers to various cse activities and programs throughout the world    there are three papers of interest in this area for curricular development    cacm preprint   from the december 1994 issue   a proposed curriculum   for a bachelor of arts degree in computational science   the text of a   proposal for an introductory cse course   a paper relating computational science and software   engineering practices      computational science and engineering must strive to make computation and science and interesting and fulfilling pursuit one attempt to do this is during the summer mentorship of south carolina student research internships our focus has been on noneuclidean geometry viewers     while we are talking about geometry he is trying to lay a constructive foundation on euclid a first report has been submitted to the logic in computer science conference    two talks were recently given at the university of stockholm stockholm sweden the slides for those presentations are available      computational science and engineering  science in the 90s this is a talk outlining cse and placing  it in the context of the working scientist and engineer      a computationalist looks at the webthis talk  discusses the authors experiences in using the web for educational purposes  it discusses some of the problems in using the current systems  the full presentation has been submitted   papers   a paper documenting an invited presentation at a workshop held at the mathematics department stockholm university this workshop discussed the computation and the internet   a paper outlining the foundations of a new programming language called eb has been submitted to popl i outline a constructive system that is different from the lambdacalculus and martinlof theories in vogue     a paper outlining the w2c project w2c takes modified warrren abstract machine wam programs and generates  c code submitted to journal of logic programming     1001 reasons for not proving your program correct is a philosophical piece concerning program correctness proofs we try to identify the arguments against from results of a survey of practitioners this is a postscript file from a framemaker file the pages blush are backwards and the original is gone sorry about that     cacm is a preprint of an article to appear in the  communications of the acm the title of this article is science computational science and computer science at a crossroads this article outlines the clemson view of computational science a version of cacm paper is to be presented at the southeastern region of siam     a paper relating computational science and software engineering practices this will be presented at the 33rd southeastern acm conference    possible projects last updated 11 april 1995 here are some ideas ive had for projects contact me stevecsclemsonedu if one of them interests you    implementation of a programming language to support constructive computational   science and engineering this language is called   eb after   errett bishop the developer of constructive analysis eb   incorporates features meant to help prove cse programs correct    the constructive foundations of eb    development of constructive theories of computational science   computational geometry including constructive graphics   given a set of n solids find the least possible volume with the   least possible surface area this is the stuffing problem   implementation of various graphicsvisulization

partly by pealing from the top of the tree and the balance with a knife this was a 5 gal nursery stock sale plant that costing 5 for about 10 years ago we blunt cut the top and let the new leader establish itself before establishing the shari the tree is 36 inches tall in the growing season this tree gets some pinching on a daily basis pinching the thing in one sitting is a bit muchthis
