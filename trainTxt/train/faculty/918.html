computer science faculty  next michael rothstein      jerry potter  professor        jerry potter received his bachelors degree from the university  of iowa his masters from stevens institute and his phd from the  university of wisconsin madison he has worked at idas supercomputing research center  goodyear aerospace xerox research and bell telephone laboratories  he is a professor of computer science at kent state university while at goodyear he was involved in software development for the staran aspro and mpp simd computers while at the supercomputing research center he performed research on the connection machine for 1 and  12 years  he has been funded by the naval ocean systems center nosc the office of  naval research onr the naval surface weapon center nswc nasa langley nasa lewis and an ohio edison innovative research grant his research interests include the continuing development of the associative computing paradigm the integration of associative simd computers with other architectures in a heterogeneous supercomputer environment the development of techniques for compilation on massively parallel simd computers natural language  and artificial intelligence processing on simd computers and the  development of techniques for the introduction of parallel programming at the high school level        selected research accomplishments       over the last 5 years dr  potter has developed and implemented the associative computing paradigm as a general purpose approach to parallel computing  his research has resulted in an associative language asc incorporating constructs to exploit associative search and memory allocation for scalable parallel computing  he has recently published a frontiers of computer science research monograph associative computing plenum publishers february 1992 on his work in associative computing  he was awarded an ohio innovator award in 1987 for his research on parallel ops5 and associative computing  he has supervised 2 ph d  students 24 ms students and refereed for numerous conferences and journals  he is also an area editor for the journal of parallel and distributed computing  he has had support from nosc and nasa
