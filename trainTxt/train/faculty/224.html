program     selected current research projects extending atm networks for reliable multicast this project involves extending atm switches to assist in the provision of endtoend reliable multicast in which the amount of work that must be done by senders and receivers is essentially independent of the size of the multicast it involves the addition of several mechanisms to atm switches one mechanism provides redundant acknowledgement suppression so that senders receive only a single acknowledgement for every packet sent a second mechanism allows multiple senders on a manytomany multicast to send multicell packets on a single virtual circuit without losing the ability to properly demultiplex them at the receiver this is done using a dynamic virtual circuit subchannel mechanism details can be found in in a recently completed technical report and set of slides    gigabit atm switching were nearing completion of a set of three chips and associated hardware and software that implements a uniquely scalable and flexible atm switch supporting link speeds from 150 mbs to 24 gbs and capable of supporting configurations with total throughputs from 10 gbs to more than 10 tbs this system uses a unique cell recycling technique for multicast switching which has optimal scaling properties allowing large switches to be implemented for a fraction of the cost of competing architectures tu93ctu94tu96 this work is part of a major arpafunded project on gigabit network technology    atm network design classical network design techniques are not wellequipped to cope with the design of atm networks which are characterized by statistically unpredictable traffic and a wide range of different application types with diverse requirements including multicast network design methods that allow network managers to define traffic requirements at a fairly gross level and adopt a worstcase approach to network design appear to be more appropriate see the following reports for recent results fi94fi96afi96b    distributed control of atm networks the design of atm switching hardware is now fairly wellunderstood however distributed control systems for effectively managing large scale networks with thousands or millions of terminals remain unavailable while a number of proposals have been put forward in the atm forum there is a limited understanding of how competing approaches compare with respect to performance use of network resources and even correctness we are developing a framework for precisely defining and analyzing network control systems that allows the essential issues to be separated from the welter of protocol and implementation details that often make it difficult to make meaningful comparisons tu95b and using this framework to develop precise characterizations of new approaches to distributed network control wu95 in addition we have designed and are implementing a particular network control system details of which can be found in dh94dh95

activities queueing analysis of multistage switching networks multistage switching networks are among the simplest and most costeffective architectures for large atm switching systems this work developed new methods for analyzing queueing performance for these systems in order to improve accuracy and extend them to handle sharedbuffer switch elements and alternative flow control strategies tu93atu93b    nonblocking multirate switching this work extends the classical theory of nonblocking networks to apply to switching systems supporting communication channels with different rates that can share the capacity of both external links and internal switch data paths it applies directly to multirate circuit switching and atm switching systems that use static routing weve obtained results generalizing classical results for both pointtopoint me89ame89b and multipoint me93a switching systems    analysis of algorithms for hard combinatorial problems this research centers on methods for analyzing the performance of algorithms for hard combinatorial problems we are interested in both worstcase analysis and probabilistic analysis the probabilistic analyses make use of problemspecific
