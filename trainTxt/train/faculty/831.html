research statement is available here  research interests   negotiation among computationally bounded selfinterested agents multiagent systems distributed problem solving distributed artificial intelligence negotiation coalition formation electronic commerce resourcebounded reasoning normative methods for system design machine learning combinatorial optimization scheduling      my primary interests lie in inherently distributed combinatorial problems  resource and task allocation and scheduling among agents with different levels of autonomy eg representing different real world enterprises that are seeking synergies by limited cooperation such settings occur for example in production scheduling in multienterprise agile manufacturing in negotiations with realworld subcontractors in vehicle routing among dispatch centers of different companies in meeting scheduling in classroom scheduling etc i am studying different commitment strategies and protocols in multiagent systems and the possibility of carrying out contracts without external enforcement i have studied the role of marginal costs as a basis for negotiation and questions of bounded rationality and deliberation scheduling when the exact computation of marginal costs is intractable i have also analyzed the effect of asynchrony and message congestion among negotiators and greater domain risk tolerance to enhance the negotiation process computationally i am currently studying the usefulness of distributed versions of a variety of combinatorial optimization algorithms from the ai and or communities some other research issues that i am currently addressing are using machine learning techniques to alternate between different negotiation strategies based on dynamic properties of the environment costbased constraint relaxation anticipation of future contracts in an agents negotiation strategy fair online profit division schemes among agents and contracts involving multiple agents as opposed to just two lately i have also developed a normative theory of coalitions among bounded rational agents    my secondary interest is machine learning on the theoretical side i lately coauthored a paper that disproved a justification for biasing decision tree induction algorithms towards generating trees with few leaves i have also coauthored an empirical paper that studied the applicability of qlearning to multiagent settings on the applied side i am currently  in cooperation with domain experts who actually need the solution  comparing a number of symbolic induction methods and neural network algorithms to enhance classification accuracy in a realworld biological problem specifically we use the methods to predict morbidity and mortality in equine colic

framework towards working among selfinterested agents whose rationality is limited by computational complexity explored the advantages of different modes of commitment and the use of marginal costs in negotiation among intelligent agents invented a method that enables autonomous computational agents to carry out exchanges without enforcement participated in the design and development of a
