august 1993           research summary      my main research goals lie in developing costeffective computer  architectures that take advantage of rapidly changing technologies  my  research program has two major thrusts       evaluating the performance  feasibility and correctness of new architectures and   developing new tools and techniques to facilitate this evaluation    currently this research focusses on the following three areas     multiparadigm multiprocessors  which efficiently integrate sharedmemory messagepassing and hybrid  programming paradigms   a virtual prototyping system which exploits the similarites  of an existing parallel machine to simulate a hypothetical parallel machine   and techniques for understanding and tuning program performance      recent results include developing a new interfacecalled  tempestbetween userlevel protocol handlers and systemsupplied  mechanisms tempest provides the mechanisms that allow programmers  compilers and program libraries to implement and use message passing  transparent shared memory and hybrid combinations of the two  tempest  mechanisms are lowoverhead messages bulk data transfer virtual  memory management and finegrain access control  the most novel  mechanismfinegrain access controlallows user software to tag  blocks eg 32 bytes as readwrite readonly or invalid so the  local memory can be used to transparently cache remote data      we are exploring alternative ways to support this interface  the firstcalled typhoonis  a proposed hardware  platform that implements the tempest mechanisms with a fullyprogrammable  userlevel processor in the network interface  a reversetranslation  table rtlb invokes the network processor when it detects a finegrain  access fault  we have simulated typhoon on the wisconsin wind tunnel and found that  a transparent sharedmemory protocol running on typhoon performs  comparably  30 to an  allhardware dirnnb cachecoherence protocol for five sharedmemory  programs      we have also developed a new memory system simulation method that  optimizes the common casecache hitssignificantly reducing  simulation time  fastcache tightly integrates reference generation and simulation by  providing the abstraction of tagged memory blocks each reference  invokes a userspecified function depending upon the reference type and  memory block state the simulator controls how references are processed  by manipulating memory block states specifying a special null function  for no action cases  fastcache implements this abstraction by using  binaryrewriting to perform a table lookup before each memory  reference on a sparcstation 10 fastcache simulation times are two to  three times faster than a conventional tracedriven simulator that  calls a procedure on each memory reference simulation times are only  three to six times slower than the original uninstrumented program  we are also investigating using fastcaches binary rewriting techniques  to support the tempest interface on existing hardware platforms       last updated july 11 1996
