research statement   programming and operating systems for high performance platforms       college of computing georgia institute of technology atlanta ga 30332 4048942589 schwanccgatechedu         prof schwan has been working with experimental and commercial  parallel machines since their inception in the late 70s his research is driven by relevant applications developed as part of a multidisciplinary laboratory at georgia tech  the hppcel laboratory contains uniprocessor and multiprocessor supercomputers a cray machine an ibm sp2 and networked sets of workstations like ibm rs6000 sun and sgi machines his research is also driven by the future heterogeneous smp and distributed systems infrastructure experienced in commercial and research settings  the distributed laboratories project is constructing a heterogeneous computing environment consisting of atmnetworked uniprocessor and smp machines jointly offering the computational power and interconnection bandwidth of modern supercomputers      applications and the  hppcel laboratory  the hppcel laboratory for experimentation with parallel applications is undertaking the development of several sample largescale parallel  applications jointly with end users   atmospheric modeling  finite element codes fluid flow applications in each case these applications not only consist of specific computational tasks but also include online analyses  being performed for these computations and realtime visualizations of program  data and monitoring of performance information all of which are executed  simultaneously such that end users can inspect program results and steer program executions to gain experimental insights additional applications used to evaluate operating system support program adaptation and programming environments research have included a robotics applications and realtime simulations the asv autonomous suspension vehicle schema based robot navigation and discrete event simulations b realtime multimedia applications involving multiple machines and human end users c the design and  implementation of interactive graphical interfaces for high performance applications and d graphbased searching algorithms used in the solution of operations research problems        distributed laboratories    the topic of our joint research is the realization of  distributed laboratories where individuals can interact with each other and more importantly with powerful distributed computational tools as readily as if all were located in a single site our intent is to permit scientists engineers and managers at geographically distinct locations including individuals telecommuting from home to combine their expertise in solving shared problems by allowing them to simultaneously view interact with and steer sophisticated computations executing on high performance distributed computing platforms prof schwans primary contribution to this effort concerns the construction of a distributed laboratory for experimentation with high performance numeric computations for applications in molecular physics atmospheric sciences working with high performance atmospheric and  pollution modelling and manufacturing systems in addition prof schwans group is involved in the development of basic technologies facilitating the use of future heterogeneous and largescale distributed and parallel systems these technologies are concerned with middleware software that will be directly utilized by distributed laboratory applications and described in more detail below   the falcon project is studying the dynamic monitoring adaptation and  interactive steering of high performance computations for online control of  virtual laboratory instruments and for whatif experimentation with  complex simulation models by distributed laboratory users    the cobs project is concerned with the distributed systems and communication technologies underlying distributed laboratory applications  the emphasis in distributed systems research is on support for sharedstate in multigranular and distributed computing environments research in communication protocols is concerned with providing the necessary communication latencies bandwidths and transmission guarantees across  heterogeneous underlying communication media       prof schwans current research addresses three basic research topics addressing the computational requirements and underlying hardware systems  presented by the hppcel and distributed laboratory efforts    programming support tools   operating systems and  communication protocols       programming tools  falcon  the  falcon  project addresses the construction of interactive parallel programs  even permitting programmers to steer such applications steering may be defined as       program steering   a program that can interact with human users during its execution where the purpose of such interactions is the use of online program information to affect or steer program execution     the falcon projects goal is to have high performance programs become  equally interactive as commonly used pc tools eg spreadsheets such that program performance is either maintained or improved the expectation is that scientists can work more effectively when able to view program results during execution and steer program execution toward useful data domains the initial experience is that online steering can improve the performance of programs by avoiding needless execution and by adapting algorithmically specific program abstractions to better match their functionality to  dynamically varying program characteristics in essence we expect to gain significant increases in the usefulness of parallel programs to end users and in program performance by use of steering      falcon offers specific support for program performance monitoring evaluation and tuning and they provide system integration support using an incore data dictionary using falcon information required for  performance tuning is easily captured analyzed displayed and then  used for program performance improvement program monitoring is  performed in an identical fashion for both shared and nonshared memory  parallel machines using languagebased and graphical user  interfaces using programming extensions of falcon now under development  program tuning is performed graphically as well by explicit manipulation  of parallel programs displayed as hierarchical sets of related objects  the tools will be used in the context of largescale parallel applications being interactively steered by end users the falcon tool is operational on suns sgis ibm rs6000 ibm sp2 and the ksr machine falcons programming extensions are still under construction but  their runtime support is already operational      adaptable operating systems the efficient execution of a parallel program requires that operating system primitives match the programs performance and reliability requirements by constructing and evaluating novel operating system mechanisms for multiple parallel architectures we are studying highperformance operating system support for multiple parallel applications including realtime applications scientific and  engineering codes discrete event simulations and optimization codes      this research has resulted in several software libraries that facilitate the construction of parallel programs the   cthreads   library is commonly used in operating systems and parallel computing courses  and is available on many uniprocessor and multiprocessor machines  its extensions toward configurable cthreads address the online monitoring and configuration of high performance parallel programs ranging  from the rapid adaptation of individual program abstractions to  userdirected program steering   specific examples of configurable abstractions constructed with the  cthreads basis include 1   adaptable multiprocessor locks  able to improve program performance by adapting lock characteristics to  program behavior during program execution and 2   adaptable communication protocols       the dsa distributed shared abstractions library for construction of  distributed objects is available on shared and in a prototype version on  distributed memory machines including networks of workstations     its purpose is to support programmers in the construction of efficient  program abstractions capable of spanning both shared memory and distributed  memory platforms its initial smp prototype is now being extended to address both sets of platforms including larger scale distributed systems see the cobs project described below      the   kernel toolkit ktk  is a substrate for parallel programming  and for the development of multiprocessor operating system kernels at the objectlevel it gives developers the ability to construct custom  implementations of objectbased operating system abstractions objects are customized using metaobjectlike interfaces described by object attributes and implemented by policies since policies may be present at runtime ktk objects may also be dynamically adapted to suit varying runtime requirements of parallel and distributed applications ktks attributes are the principal basis for construction of adaptable objects in the cobs project described next      the  gitc c9335 lda
