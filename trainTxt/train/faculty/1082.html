summary      we are primarily developing machine learning systems that combine the  strengths of symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence with those of  connectionist ai  a major focus is improving the dialog between human  teachers and machine learners  traditionally this interaction is limited to  the teacher providing labelled training examples to the machine  toward the  goal of widening the communication pipeline between human and machine we  have been developing a language for providing in a natural manner and at any  time generalpurpose advice to a machine learner  in our approach the human  advicegiver observes the behavior of the learner and occasionally makes  suggestions expressed in a simple language  based on techniques developed in  our work on knowledgebased neural networks these instructions are inserted  directly into learner  subsequent connectionist neural network learning  further integrates and refines the advice        currently we are extending the language used to advise our learning algorithms   studying new ways of incorporating this advice into neural networks  investigating the extraction of humancomprehensible rules from trained neural networks  and developing methods for choosing good representations for training examples    we are also developing parallel algorithms   on the departments condor system and our cm5 computer  for machine learning and computational biology        shavlik 1992   and 1996  provide an overview of our approach to knowledgebased neural networks  recent developments appear in the papers referenced on
