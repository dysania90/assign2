science            gary lindstrom is a graduate of carnegiemellon university where he earned bs and ms degrees in mathematics and a phd in computer science  he is currently professor of computer science at the university of utah having taught previously at the university of pittsburgh  among dr lindstroms research interests are programming language design specification and implementation with special emphasis on the programming aspects of parallel and distributed systems he has served as an ieee computer society distinguished visitor and has been awarded the university of utah college of engineering outstanding teaching award  dr lindstrom recently retired as editor in chief of the   international journal of parallel programming and coedited the book  logic programming functions relations and equations  his research has been supported by nsf arpa onr and industrial sponsors mcc ibm xerox ncr and l m ericsson he served on the nsf computer and computation research advisory committee from 1988 to 1992 and as a  consultant to the united nations development programme in 1988 dr lindstrom is chair of the organick  memorial lecture series        current research projects  persistent object stores the mach shared objects project is building an object manager om layered on modern operating systems  our om is based on system server concepts presenting a standardized interface to c and common lisp cl programs  the mso approach to persistence emphasizes i generality of source language support ii portability and heterogeneity iii data evolution iv distributed implementation and access and v the representation of software components as objects managed through a pervasive system service      module manipulation tools the fast and flexible machbased systems project seeks to develop an operating system that provides a much higher degree of flexibility than do traditional systems and to use that added flexibility to circumvent the performancefunctionality tradeoffs that thwart traditional highlydecomposed microkernelbased operating systems foundations for this work include i a comprehensive notion of modules ii module manipulation cast as a system service and iii a semantically enriched notion of module compatibility and adaptability  items i and ii arose from the mach shared objects project see above while iii is a new emphasis motivated by pragmatically important intermodule concerns such as address space sharing storage management policies and levels of trust   software for human genetics applications in collaboration with the  utah center for human genome research software is being developed to aid in genetic applications such as linkage analysis genetic and physical mapping and large scale genetic sequencing key aspects include i data modeling using relational and objectoriented database management systems ii sequencing production workflow simulation planning and realtime control and iii automated inspection monitoring and robotic manipulation of biochemical laboratory processes the educational dimension of this collaboration centers on an interdisciplinary program in  genome science     selected publications
