   rick received the ba degree in history and mathematics computer science  option from the  college of  william and mary  in 1977 and the ms and phd degrees in computer  science from  cornell university   in 1979 and 1982 respectively         since 1982 rick has been in the   department of computer science  at   the university of arizona  where he is currently   holds the rank of professor  his research interests include   distributed systems faulttolerant computing and heterogeneous   scientific applications  in the latter area he heads the    schooner project   whose goal is to provide software support for constructing scientific  metacomputations across networks of heterogeneous machines  much of his current work in faulttolerant computing involves  using the xkernel in various ways to support faulttolerance and is done  in cooperation with members of the     network systems research group   he currently supervises one postdoctoral   associate   matti hiltunen    and four graduate students    nina bhatti  ilwoo chang xiaonan han  and   don waugaman        rick is also active in promoting increased   interaction between us and japanese computer scientists   he spent seven months in 1990 visiting the      katayama laboratory at tokyo institute of technology   where he worked on using an attributegrammar formalism to implement  faulttolerant software  he is currently spending a year at    hitachi central research laboratory near tokyo working on  various software issues related to heterogeneous scientific computation   both of these visits have been supported by  the nsf usjapan cooperative science program       rick is a member of acm ieee and   the   ifip working  group 104 on dependable computing and faulttolerance    he is on the editorial boards of ieee transactions on computers  ieee parallel and distributed technology and  the springerverlag series on dependable computing and faulttolerant systems  he is also current vicechair of the ieee technical committee on  faulttolerant computing and has served on numerous conference  program committees in the areas of fault tolerance and distributed   computing  he was general chair of the second ifip working   conference on dependable computing for critical applications in 1991  and program committee chair of the thirteenth ieee symposium on  reliable distributed computing in 1994       as part of his japan activities rick heads the   japancs  project  and is founder and  current moderator of the usenet newsgroup     compresearchjapan  an  electronic forum devoted to japanese research developments in  computing and computer science  he is also a member of the association of research libraries  working group on japanese scientific and technical information       when not working rick likes to haunt local japanese restaurants  with his family  their favorite is samurai which during the winter  months serves the best miso ramen this side of japan  rick also  follows the arizona wildcat sports teams         some recent talks               an approach to constructing configurable highlevel protocols       for fault tolerance invited talk dept of eecs univ       of
