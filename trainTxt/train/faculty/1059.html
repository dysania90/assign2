leader wisconsin computer vision group    program cochair cvpr 96      research interests  view synthesis the goal of this work is to develop basic tools for controlling in realtime either autonomously or interactively a virtual camera of a real environment  the input is a set of images or video streams acquired from fixed or mobile cameras around a site and the output is a panoramic visualization of the scene in which a virtual usercontrolled camera can be moved through the environment   with this technology a user could interactively navigate through a real environment controlling a customized path of views of the site that are not predetermined by the input images  the main research question is how to adaptively combine a set of basis images to synthesize new views of the scene without 3d models or 3d scene reconstruction as an intermediate step   recently we have developed an innovative technique which we call view morphing that takes two basis images and interpolates a continuous range of inbetween images  corresponding to views on the linear path connecting the two camera centers     visual exploration computer vision researchers have recently started to investigate how to actively control the image acquisition process by controlling camera parameters   we have been studying how to purposefully control the position and orientation of a camera in order to dynamically adjust viewpoint based on the appearance of a threedimensional scene the use of realtime viewpointcontrol behaviors is important for solving tasks such as exploring an unknown object in order to find specific surface markings building a global model of an unknown shape or recognizing an object    by coordinating simple observer behaviors that change the appearance of surfaces in a welldefined way we simplify the image computations required make precise the global progress of an algorithm and eliminate the need for accurate differential measurements of the camera motion we believe that this active approach of moving towards viewpoints that are closely related to the geometry of the viewed objects is a very important and general one we have used this approach to develop provablycorrect algorithms for 1 moving to a side view of a surface of revolution in order to recover its shape and 2 reconstructing the global surface of an unknown smooth arbitrarilyshaped object     visualization in the area of visualization we have developed mapping techniques capable of generating displays of all possible data objects defined in a users algorithm without the need for userdefined typespecific graphics display procedures this capability for displaying arbitrary combinations of an algorithms data objects in a common frame of reference coupled with interactive control of algorithm execution provides a powerful way to understand algorithm behavior especially interactive visual experiments with scientific data analysis algorithms we have implemented a system called visad for experimenting with these techniques and have used it for visualizing intermediate and final results of data analysis algorithms for problems such as discriminating clouds in satellite images     recent publications   s m seitz and c r dyer      cyclic motion analysis using the period trace      in motionbased recognition m shah and      r jain eds
