for ilp architectures   shared memory multiprocessors   memory systems           research summary          my current research focuses on the design of the  highest performance uniprocessors of a current generation  currently we are investigating the architecture of  a circa 2000 processor  with plenty of transistors available  on a chip the challenge is to use these resources to get  the highest possible performance when executing a sequential program  a target that we have set for ourselves is to sustain the execution of  over 10 instructions per cycle  for ordinary nonnumeric application programs      my research group is investigating several issues that need  to be resolved before our goals can be achieved  we are studying and characterizing the  nature of instructionlevel parallelism in nonnumeric  application programs in order to understand the available parallelism and  how it could be exploited  the bulk of my groups research effort is expended in continuing the  development of the   multiscalar  processing model  a novel paradigm for exploiting ilp  currently we are developing the multiscalar compiler and  carrying out detailed simulation studies to assess  the potential of the multiscalar concept            current graduate students     todd austin   scott breach   andreas moshovos   tn vijaykumar        recent talks        will
