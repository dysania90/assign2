          research summary    my research is aimed at creating tools to support the  development of complex software systems  the objective is to create  tools that provide powerful languagespecific programmanipulation  operations  in particular my work has explored how program slicing  can serve as the basis for such programmanipulation operations      the slice of a program with respect to a set of program elements  s is  a projection of the program that includes only program elements that  might affect either directly or transitively the values of the  variables used at members of s  slicing allows one to find  semantically meaningful decompositions of programs where the  decompositions consist of elements that are not textually contiguous      program slicing is a fundamental operation that can aid in solving  many softwareengineering problems  for instance it has applications  in program understanding maintenance debugging testing  differencing specialization reuse and merging      the projects that my coworkers and i are carrying out are aimed at      improving the underlying technology for program slicing and related  operations    implementing program slicers    developing methods for using slicing in softwareengineering tools and    building slicingbased programmanipulation tools    click  here  for the home page of the wisconsin program slicing project      recently we established some unexpected connections between  interprocedural dataflow analysis and our previous work on  interprocedural program slicing  in particular we showed that a large class of interprocedural  dataflowanalysis problems can be solved by transforming  them into a special kind of graphreachability problem  this graphreachability problem can be solved precisely in polynomial time  by the algorithm originally developed for interprocedural slicing      i am also interested in the subject of incremental algorithms  by an incremental algorithm  i mean an algorithm that makes use of the solution to one problem  instance to find the solution to a nearby problem instance             categorized index to publications        program slicing differencing merging etc
