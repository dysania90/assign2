symposium on learning complex behaviors       research interests     intelligent information processing systems are likely to   play a most significant role in the 21st century and    the design and analysis of these systems is one  of the great scientific challenges we face today  consider the following realistic possibilities which are  currently the main focus of ongoing work in intelligent   systems research around the globe        an intelligent vision system installed in a car tracks   the road and wakes up the dozing driver when the car is beginning to   to head towards the shoulder thousands of lives could be saved   annually  another datadriven system could help to perform precise  radioactive therapy on a cancerous tumor  in a way that minimizes damage to adjacent cells    an interactive automated system could consider a set of symptoms   and warn of a likely heart attack in an emergency room patient  another medical system can perform sophisticated analysis   of a collection of tests help assess the probability of cancer   recurrence and suggest a schedule for repeated evaluations         the basic principle driving these systems is that they can  learn to function from very large corpuses of data  what makes this technology possible is the remarkable   match between the massive amount of information that can be stored on   modern computers and the amazing computational capabilities speed   of these machines       our society is currently entering a new period   where massive amounts of heterogeneous information are generated   and stored on computers and are readily available for exploration  over academic networks digital libraries and   commercial information services  at the same time modern networks of computers can perform   billions of computation steps per second  this rather unique match of raw computer power   and sea of available information creates many previously   unfeasible opportunities for building intelligent systems   coping with information explosion scientific data mining   interactive modelling of unstructured data and complex processes   and intelligent datadriven decisionmaking with uncertainty  are among the major current focus areas in computer science            one striking example of the use of this computing power   was a recent application developed at johns hopkins university  a chess endgame analysis program designed by lewis stiller   running on a 65536 processor machine and using gigabytes of storage found   chess endgames that absolutely require more than 220 moves to win a   simple chess game  chess masters for generations   used a rule that declared a draw after only 50 moves  the old rule was dictated by human experience that could not   perform this type of analysis          a different program implemented by an interdisciplinary group of   researchers from astronomy and computer science  automatically finds stars galaxies or filters cosmic rays in   images obtained by the hubble telescope    this program is using a decision tree induction system   implemented by s murthy at the johns hopkins university  this program is very fast and can easily process millions of   astronomical objects in a short amount of time        my current research program focuses on   highperformance computer systems and efficient algorithms  that provide the computational capabilities to support this   critical information technology  our main focus is the design and analysis of  algorithms for highperformance intelligent systems specifically we  are interested in efficient parallel and sequential algorithms for   modelling and controlling complex processes eg computer systems or   neural networks   intelligent information retrieval and modelling of large data   depositories that can be used in educational environments   constraint networks and probabilistic networks that can be used for   decisionmaking with uncertainty eg medical diagnosis    and machine learning  the algorithms designed by our group  have been applied to a variety of applications such as  public health  computer vision computer game playing   astronomy and several biomedical applications             academic experience         jun 1991 amp present associate professor dept of computer science                     joint appointment in cognitive science since 1989    july
