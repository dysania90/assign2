problems in programming computers  as part of the  wisconsin wind tunnel wwt  project i have  helped develop a hybrid softwarehardware sharedmemory computer  architecture that facilitates programming and compiling for parallel  machines  currently my students and i are developing languages compilers  and tools to demonstrate and exploit the power of userlevel coherence  policies      im also interested performance evaluation tools that help programmers  understand and improve their programs performance  recently tom ball and  i developed an efficient path profiling algorithm which provides a more  detailed understanding of controlflow within routines and which has  identified new possibilities for better compilers      last modified fri nov  1 211709 1996 by james larus
