history up to today  i received my phd at berkeley under prof eugene wong working on database  design and translation within the ingres relational database project i had the good fortune to have also worked one summer with the systemr relational database group at ibms san jose research laboratory so i was located in the center of the relational database design and implementation universe    after my phd and some career fits and starts i landed at the university of wisconsinmadison where i shifted my interests into vlsi and cad in particular database support for vlsi cad environments i was so successful that an opportunity presented itself to return to berkeley in 1983 which i accepted gladly selling my snow tires since that time my research and teaching interests have focused on the design engineering and implementation of advanced high performance computing systems      always one to exhibit a short attention span in 1984 i switched from cad to processor and memory system design between 1985 and 1989 i led the design of the distributed cache and virtual memory organization of the spur multiprocessor project we invented the term snooping caches also known as snoopy caches and implemented one of the first invalidation protocols the overall spur project was led by dave patterson and involved richard fateman paul hilfinger dave hodges and john ousterhout snooping cache schemes are used in many multiprocessor servers on the market today      in 1986 i had an idea for building high performance storage systems by ganging together a large number of small formfactor disk drives much like the processors in a multiprocessor between 1987 and 1992 i led the design and implementation of the berkeley raid redundant arrays of inexpensive disks high performance storage system we coined the term raid this work was done in overall collaboration with dave patterson and john ousterhout click here for a picture of raid the first and here for a picture of raid the second which is still functional in 1996 this is the innovative shelves of disks that gave us such incredible mbytes per square foot for its time 72 35 disks in a 19 rack this multibillion dollar per year industry all started with a simple idea in berkeley in 1986 too bad i didnt get any royalities      unsatisfied with academic life as usual and after the elections of 1992 i decided to take a leave during 19931994 at the computing systems technology office now information technology office of the defense advanced research projects agency i started as a program manager and ended as an office deputy director however along the way i was responsible for establishing whitehousegov and the president and vicepresident internet mail accounts i participated on vice president gores   national performance review and played a lead role in formulating the   federal hpcc programs information  infrastructure technology and applications research program in support  of the administrations   national

really looking forward to voting for al gore for president in the year 2000    on july 1 1996 i became the first computer scientist to be the chair of the department of electrical engineering and computer science      research interests of the moment    wireless communications and mobile computing      growing out of bob brodersens infopad project we have been working to develop wireless networking and applications support technologies that make it possible to support seamless roaming within buildings and over the wide area while efficiently supporting applications that process realtime streams like video as well as web documents    our current interest is to examine the issues of wirelesswireline network integration internetwork operation and endtoend quality of service guarantees in the context of a localarea wireless testbed in soda hall and a widearea testbed located in the san francisco bay area the overall effort in collaboration with eric brewer is called the  daedalus project  the combined inbuilding metropolitanarea and widearea testbed is called  barwan bay area research wireless access network this work is supported by the defense advanced research projects agency under its glomo program   heterogeneous collaboration environments    with steve mccanne who is joining the faculty this year we are studying how to extend the technology we have developed for adapting data representations in realtime into a comprehensive open framework for collaboration elements of this new effort include roomsized collaboration environments extensive enhancements to the existing mbone collaboration tools and integration of wireless access into the collaboration environment we expect to deploy these technologies in a classroom testbed within soda hall click here to see a version of our darpa proposal that supports this work     faculty book club  with several of the cs faculty and other interested faculty members elsewhere on campus i have
