professor   computer science department   university of utah          professor carter joined the department of computer science in january 1993  his research interests include operating systems parallel and distributed  computing and multiprocessor computer architecture  of particular  interest are scalable shared memory architecture designs both hardware and  software  dr carter is coleading two arpasponsored research projects  the avalanche scalable multiprocessor  architecture design effort and the fast  and flexible machbased systems effort aka mach 4  the development  of an efficient and highly portable distributed shared memory system quarks is part of this effort          while a graduate student at rice university he designed implemented and  evaluated munin a distributed shared memory system that allows  shared memory parallel programs to be executed efficiently on distributed  memory multiprocessors  he has also worked on  high speed bulk data  communication protocols            for the fall quarter of 1995 i will be teaching the  introduction to operating systems  course cs506  meeting times are tuesdaythursday from 110pm235pm  in emcb 102        current research projects          avalanche scalable multiprocessor design    the goal of this project to develop an integrated cache memory and  communication architecture that significantly reduces the latency of both  distributed shared memory and message passage multiprocessor communication  the core processor of avalanche will be the forthcoming parisc 8000 cpu  we are designing a new context sensitive cache controller unit  that will support a flexible suite of cache coherence protocols for dsm  applications and provide context sensitive injection of incoming data into  the appropriate level of the memory hierarchy in order to minimize message  latency    primary research collaborators  al davis  ravindra kuramkote and  chenchi kuo  other research collaborators  mark swanson  leigh stoller  benny yih and  ashley saulsbury            fast and flexible machbased systems  the goal of this project is to develop an operating system that provides a  much higher degree of flexibility than traditional operating systems and  to use that added flexibility to circumvent the performancefunctionality  tradeoffs that thwart traditional highlydecomposed microkernelbased  operating systems  important components of this work are a module  management service lightweight and decomposed mach kernel functionality  aggressive exploitation of interprocess sharing and efficient distributed  shared memory see below  we will maintain backward compatibility where  practical and freely distribute an unencumbered version of the entire  system  primary research collaborators  jay lepreau  mike hibler  jeff law and  bryan ford            quarks distributed shared memory system  the goal of this project is to develop an efficient portable and freely  available distributed shared memory system to support the shared memory  programming style on distributed memory multiprocessors and networks of  workstations  ideally quarks will eventually do for distributed shared memory what pvm  did for message passing  make it relatively easy to use pervasive  ported to a wide array of systems and reasonably efficient  for more on our motivation take a look at my  hotos 95 position paper  an   alpha release of quarks is currently available that runs on sunos  41sparc machines but ports are in progress to 68k bsd boxes  hpuxparisc irix 52mips and the mach operating system  primary research collaborators  dilip khandekar and  linus kamb        here is a copy of the slides for my osdi 94   tutorial on distributed shared memory minus some of the graphs  which i will incorporate soon                  significant past research projects      munin distributed shared memory system    munin was the first software distributed shared memory system to explore  the potential performance benefits of using a relaxed consistency model  among munins novel features were a software implementation of the release  consistency model the first multiple writer memory consistency  protocol to address the problem of false sharing support for  multiple consistency protocols including usersupplied protocols and an  update timeout mechanism to reduce the communication overhead of write  update protocols  for shared memory programs with moderate to high degrees  of sharing munin achieved far greater performance speedup than  conventional distributed shared memory systems usually within 10 of hand  coded message passing performance  many of the features and ideas first  developed in munin have appeared in subsequent dsm systems  primary  research collaborators willy zwaenepoel  and john bennett  here is a copy of my dissertation concerning munin        optimistic bulk data transfer protocol    the key insight exploited in this effort was that when the first packet in  a blast of bulk data is received by a node it is highly likely that no  packet outside the blast will arrive before the last bulk data packet is  received  as such upon receipt of the first packet in a blast of bulk  data the network device layer should set things up to optimize this case  this optimization which was independently observed by van jacobson and  incorporated into tcpip resulted in 92 mbps bulk data transfer rates  between two sun350s on a 10 mbps ethernet  at the time the best tcpip  implementations achieved under 5 mbps bulk data transfer rates    primary research collaborators  willy zwaenepoel                selected publications          jb carter jk bennett and w zwaenepoel    techniques for reducing consistencyrelated
