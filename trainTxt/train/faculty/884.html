major research interests cover a broad range of topics in the general area of systems and contro given the rapidly changing scenario in research i believe that a healthy mix  of theory and applications is perhaps the most appropriate strategy currently with my students and i am most actively  working on the following topics   applications of control technology to microelectronics manufacturing processes   robust control theory   control oriented identification  and modeling   applications of control to automotive xerography and electromechanical systems     in a major interdisciplinary research thrust a group of faculty from the control systems laboratory and the solid state electronics laboratory has started a new research program on applications of control technology to semiconductor and display manufacturing processes we have several projects in this area i am the center director  for the muri center on intelligent electronics  manufacturing the main research thrusts of this center include modeling sensing and control of plasma etching and deposition processes i am also a thrust group leader in the center for display technology and manufacturing and a participating faculty member in the src center of excellence on automated semiconductor manufacturing  these activities are also focused on applications of modern control and systems theory to plasma based microelectronics  manufacturing processes in our initial work we have focused on real time and runtorun control of plasma reactive ion etching process which is a major unit process step starting from a conceptual control strategy we have designed and implemented a real time control system for this process on an applied 8300 hexode reactor experimental results  have shown that real time feedback control could have major impact on the performance characteristics of the reactive ion etchers more recently we have developed nonlinear estimators for calculating etch rate from singlemultiple wavelegth laser  inteferometers we have also developed a combined runtorun and realtime controller for the rie process    in control theory our  research is analysis and synthesis of control systems that give optimal performance given an approximate model of the physical system to be controlled this is an extremely important problem since in practice one rarely has an exact model for the physical system modeling uncertainty arises due to incomplete and inexact experimental data simplifying approximations neglected high frequency dynamics etc our research has focused on the problem of robust stabilization for a variety of possible modeling uncertainties our results have yielded necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of robust stabilization problems and constructive algorithms for solving these problems this research is also closely connected to our work on hinfinity optimal control a new development in our research on robust control is the analysis and synthesis of robust sampleddata control systems  here we have focused on developing analytical tools for robustness analysis and synthesis of sampleddata systems in htwo and hinfinity  norm    models are the basis for much of control systems analysis and design in a new major effort we have begun research in empirical model building i e system identification we are exploring frequency domain techniques for building system models which are suitable for robust control analysis and design we have applied some of this recent work to the reactive ion etching problem as well as to the jpl example more recent work has focused structured nonlinear models such as hammerstein  systems from empirical data    we  are also actively  pursuing  applications  of modern control and systems techniques to automotive systems  our initial work focused on an idle speed fluctuation reduction problem where a novel nonlinear control strategy has given promising results on nonlinear simulations more recently we have focused on modeling and control of single and double transition shift transmissions   this work is being done in collaboration with engineers from general motors    in collaboration with engineers at xerox and professor dan koditschek we have started a new project on control of the color xerography process    for more details you are invited to read our publications
