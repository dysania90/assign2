research interests mainly focus on three areas paralleldistributed computing software toolenvironment development and scientific computing i and my colleagues in the  high performance and software lab  are investigating several research and technical issues into performance evaluation and system support of heterogeneous networks of workstations now we concentrate on three problem areas 1 developing performance metrics and providing insights into special natures of heterogeneous distributed computing 2 providing system support to effectively manage heterogeneity and scheduling computation tasks across networks 3 building software tool and environment to aid parallel and distributed computing and performance evaluation our studies on parallel systems also include several topics of sharedmemory and dataparallel computing our system research is motivated and driven by our studies of largescale scientific applications such as numerical simulations nonlinear optimizations and image
