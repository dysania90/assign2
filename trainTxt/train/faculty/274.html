that champion liberty none of those in charge will encourage truly critical scrutiny of mainstream political affairs  none will raise such questions as why should government deprive the successful of the fruits of their success or even the fortunate of their good fortune just because others do not enjoy the same    or who among those who feed off the welfare state so successfully would ever raise the question mr president if we spend borrowed money our children will have to be taxed to repay does this not violate the principle no taxation without representation    would any such journalist raise the question to some politician or bureaucrat if in the criminal law it is wrong to punish people unless they have been proven guitly of a crime why is it right that government regulations may impose enormous economic burdens on people who have done nothing wrong isnt this a kind of prior restraint that has no place in a free society    what about the question if the 14th amendment prohibits the unequal application of the law why are producers prohibited from discriminating while consumers can do so with total impunity  and why can government regulate every profession but the press arts and clergyis this not a builtin inequality a statesponsored discrimination  leonard e read 18981983 founding president of fee the foundation for economic education said that in an ideal

this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it    if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be fixed by decisions of the supreme court then the people will have ceased to be their own rulers  abraham lincoln first inaugural address march 4 1861     the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court  the people will have ceased to be their own rulers having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal    if i dont have to do it it only shows that you dont have to either    we all declare for liberty but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing    we

assigned to save us from the terror of highquality low priced foreign tv sets or the subsidy on 6000 bushels of wheat to prop up the soviet regime  surely civilization would collapse without such essential services  albert einstein my first impression of the usa 1921  the prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the prohibition law for nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced it is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this    albert einstein  heroism on command senseless violence and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism  how passionately i hate them  albert gallatin of the new york historical society 7 october 1789  the whole of the bill of rights is a declaration of the right of the people at large or considered as individuals  it establishes some rights of the individual as unalienable and which consequently no majority has a right to deprive them of  hamilton didnt argue that a select militia made a general militia unnecessary but rather that a general militia was insufficient by itself to adequately protect the nation    federalist 28 or 29        but so far from viewing the matter in the same light with those who      object to select corps as dangerous were the constitution ratified      and were i to deliver my sentiments to a member of the federal      legislature from this state on the subject of a militia establishment      i should hold to him in substance the following discourse        the project of disciplining all the militia of the united      states is as futile as it would be injurious if it were capable of      being carried into execution  a tolerable expertness in military      movements is a business that requires time and practice  it is not      a day or even a week that will suffice for the attainment of it      to oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other classes      of the citizens to be under arms for the purpose of going through      military exercises and evolutions as often as might be necessary to      acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the      character of a wellregulated militia would be a real grievance to      the people and a serious public inconvenience and loss  it would      form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country      to an amount which calculating upon the present numbers of the      people would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil      establishments of all the states  to attempt a thing which would      abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent      would be unwise and the experiment if made could not succeed      because it would not long be endured  little more can reasonably be      aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them      properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not      neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in      the course of a year    alexander hamilton collected in federalist paper 28 originally in the 10 january 1788 daily advertiser  if the representatives of the people betray their constituents there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of selfdefence which is paramount to all positive forms of government and which against the usurpations of the national rulers may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against the rulers of an individual state  in a single state if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers the different parcels subdivisions or districts of which it consists having no distinct government in each can take no regular measures for defense  the citizens must rush tumultuously to arms without concert without system without resource except in their courage and despair    alexander hamilton federalist paper 29 on the organization of the militia little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year  vffrkba    alexander hamilton federalist paper 29 speaking of standing armies   if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellowcitizens vffrkba    alexander hamilton federalist paper 79 regarding payment of judges  in the general course of human nature a power over a mans subsistence amounts to a power over his will vff    alexander hamilton the federalist papers at 184188 cannot verify  the best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed    alexander hamilton advice to jurors to acquit against the judges instructions   if exercising their judgment with discretion and honesty they have a clear conviction that the charge of the court is wrong    hamilton federalist 84 i go further and affirm that bills of rights in the sense and to the extent in which they are contended for are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution but would even be dangerous  they would contain various exceptions to powers not granted and on this very account would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted for why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do  why for instance should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed i will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power but it is evident that it would furnish to men disposed to usurp a plausible pretense for claiming that power  alexis de tocqueville  the american republic will endure until politicians realize they can bribe the people with their own money    alexis de tocqueville  to commit violent and unjust acts it is not enough for a government to have the will or even the power the habits ideas and passions of the time must lend themselves to their committal    alexis de tocqueville  where are we then  the religionists are the enemies of liberty and the friends of liberty attack religion the highminded and the noble advocate subjection and the meanest and most servile minds preach independence honest and enlightened citizens are opposed to all progress whilst men without patriotism and without principles are the apostles of civilization and intelligence  has such been the fate of the centuries which have preceded our own  and has man always inhabited a world like the present where nothing is linked together where virtue is without genius and genius without honor where the love of order is confounded with a taste for oppression and the holy rites of freedom with a taste for law where the light thrown by conscience on human actions is dim and where nothing seems to be any longer forbidden or allowed honorable or shameful false or true  algernon sidney 1672  the only ends for which governments are constituted and obedience rendered to them are the obtaining of justice and protection and they who cannot provide for both give the people a right of taking such ways as best please themselves in order to their own safety  andrew ford usenet  the price of liberty is always has been and always will be blood the person who is not willing to die for his liberty has already lost it to the first scoundrel who is willing to risk dying to violate that persons liberty are you free    andrew ford usenet  without either the first or second amendment we would have no liberty the first allows us to find out whats happening the second allows us to do something about it the second will be taken away first followed by the first and then the rest of our freedoms  andrew jackson 8th annual message to congress dec 5 1836  it is apparent from the whole context of the constitution as well as the history of the times which gave birth to it that it was the purpose of the convention to establish a currency consisting of the precious metals  these were adopted by a permanent rule excluding the use of a perishable medium of exchange such as certain agricultural commodities recognized by the statutes of some states as tender for debts or the still more pernicious expedient of paper currency  aristotle  money being naturally barren to make it breed money is preposterous and a perversion from the end of its institution which was only to serve the purpose of exchange and not of increase   usury is most reasonably detested as the increase arises from the money itself and not by employing it to the purpose for which it was intended  benjamin disraeli  the world is governed by far different personages than what is imagined by those not behind the scenes  benjamin franklin 1759

more for its support and the other to pay less  and this has alone occasioned great convulsions actual civil wars ending either in dethroning of the princes or enslaving of the people  generally indeed the ruling power carries its point the revenues of princes constantly increasing and we see that they are never satisfied but always in want of more  the more the people are discontented with the oppression of taxes the greater need the prince has of money to distribute among his partisans and pay the troops that are to suppress all resistance and enable him to plunder at pleasure  there is scarce a king in a hundred who would not if he could follow the example of pharoah get first all the peoples money then all their lands and then make them and their children servants for ever

it  there it presently becomes tyranny whether those that thus use it are one or many    the people cannot delegate to government the power to do anything which would be unlawful for them to do themselves     whenever the legislators endeavor to take away and destroy the property of the people or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power they put themselves into a state of war with the people who are thereupon absolved from any farther obedience and are left to the common refuge which god hath provided for all men against force and violence  whensoever therefore the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society and either by ambition fear folly or corruption endeavor to grasp themselves or put into the hands of any other an absolute power over the lives

kates attorney and criminologist points out fallacies behind current gun control proposals critiques academic research on gun use murder and violence research upon which most of the antigun lobby mistakenly relies and reveals aspects of the issue that have not received full attention from either opponents or proponents of gun control including the overlooked implications of gun control on the issue of women and selfdefense     kates cites a survey by the national institute of justice that   shows most criminals are more worried about meeting an armed   victim than they are about running into the police  while   handguns are used in vast numbers of crimes annually they are used   more often by good citizens to repel crime approximately 581000   crimes vs about 645000 defense uses annually  this finding is   even more startling because kates relied on an exhaustive review of   antigun sponsored studies to compile the gun use figures     kates also examines national studies many of them again sponsored   by the antigun lobby to test the claim that most murders are   acquaintance murders committed by normally law abiding citizens   who murder because of the accessibility of a gun in a moment of   anger  he finds instead that murderers are highly disturbed   aberrant individuals characterized by felony records alcohol   andor drug dependence and life histories of irrational violence   against people around them  these studies reveal that 744   percent of arrested murderers nationally had prior arrests for   violent felony or burglary and on average an adult record of a six   year criminal career with four major felony arrests     the study has important implications for those concerned with issue   of women and selfdefense women and rape and the batteredwife   syndrome  it is not uncommon in most academic research on gun use   by women in cases of attack and rape to find the totally   insupportable view that women would invariably be too suprised by   violent attack to use a handgun in selfdefense  kates points   out on the contrary that in most instances the man who beats or   murders a woman often even the rapist is an acquaintance who has   previously assaulted her on one or more occasions  she is   therefore prepared and uniquely qualified to anticipate a violent   attack based on her own experience of previous confrontations      in cases of criminal violence between spouses 91 percent of the   victims were women  kates cites studies affirming that in the   overwhelming majority of cases where wife kills husband she is   defending herself or the children  in detroit for instance   husbands are killed by wives more often than vice versa yet men   are far more often convicted for killing a spouse  because   threequarters of wives who killed were not even charged   prosecutors having found their acts lawful and necessary to   preserve their lives or their childrens  eliminating handguns   says kates would almost guarantee that the sex of the victims of   interspousal homicide would be female    other major findings of kates study include     differentials in international crime rates are a function of   sociocultural and economic factors not the percentage of gun   ownership  in fact there is an inverse correlation between   violence rates and the percentage of gun ownership in many foreign   countries the most noteworthy being switzerland and israel     a handgun ban is not realistically enforceable  confiscating guns   would require housetohouse searches and alienate the very   individuals whose compliance is essential to the success of any   regulation  if gun ownership were prohibited organized crime   would step in to provide the firearms that will continue to be   procured with criminal intent     with respect to police protection as an alternative for gun   ownership the police do not exist to protect the individual   citizen  rather their function is to deter crime in general by   patrol activities and by apprehension after the crime has   occurred  response to crisis calls in many urban police   departments is slow due to staff limitations and sheer volume of   emergency demands  given that the individual and not the police   must be responsible for the individuals safety the issue is   whether those individuals should be free to choose gun ownership as   a means of protecting themselves their homes and their families     controls over handguns but not rifles and shotguns may result in   the counterproductive substitution of these weapons in accident   and assault situations where long weapons are far more problematic   the fact is says kates for a host of technical reasons long   guns are both far more susceptible to accidental discharge than   handguns and are far more deadly when so discharged  particularly   for small children    to order a copy of this new study at 500copy please call 415 9890833 fax 415

however the police forces of this country are unable to protect you directly and are not responsible for doing so in any event       the purpose of the police force is to provide indirect deterrence to crime through patrolling the streets and by apprehending the criminal after the criminal act has occurred            it would be impossible for the police to protect you the individual at all times  there are approximately 550000 peace officers in this country  they work three shifts a day so their number must be divided by three in order to determine how many are available to patrol the streets this number must be halved again to account for the percentage of the force dedicated to support roles paperwork booking lab work training etc this leaves less than 100000 officers to patrol the streets at any given time  these officers are facing 10000000 criminals that is to say they are outnumbered 100 to 1 figures from prof john bowman u of illinois            recognizing the logistical impossibility of providing aroundtheclock full coverage our legal system has consistently held that the police have no legal duty to you the individual            in california the california government code sections 821845846 reads         a public employee is not liable for an injury caused by his      failure to enforce any enactment law  neither a public entity     not a public employee is liable for failure to  provide police     protection  or to provide sufficient police protection  or for     injury caused by the failure to make an arrest or the failure to attain     an arrested person in custody            in illinois the illinois rev statutes 4102 state the matter more clearly         neither a public entity or a public employee may be sued for failure     to provide adequate police protection or service failure to prevent the     commission of crimes and failure to apprehend criminals            in the case of riss vs city of new york 1961 the supreme court held that even though ms riss had asked the police for help six times previously warning them of threats made against her by a rejected suitor the police could not be held liable for their failure to prevent him from throwing acid in her face disfiguring her for life            in the case of warren vs district of columbia 1981 2 women were upstairs in their house and heard their other roommate being attacked downstairs by rapists  they called the police and when 12 hour later the noise downstairs had stopped for some time because their roommate had been beaten into unconsciousness went downstairs to meet the police            in the words of the court for the next fourteen hours the women were held captive raped robbed beaten forced to commit sexual acts upon one another and made to submit to the sexual demands of their attackers their calls were mishandled by the dispatcher  the police never came to their aid            the court held that the fundamental principle of american law that a government and its agents are under no general duty to provide public services such as police protection to any individual citizen absolved the police and the city government from any liability in the case            so think about this as you are debating whether people should be able to keep weapons for selfdefense or not  if you truly believe the police will protect you when you need it you are potentially fatally mistaken            in the final analysis you must be responsible for the safety of your family and yourself  no one else is  more statistics from am gottliebs gunrightsfactbook p596061    according to the statisticalabstractoftheunitedstates 1987 edition there were only 1695 firearms accidents that led to deaths in 1983over 999 of all households with a handgun did not experience a fatal firearms accident during the yearduring 1983there were also over 44000 deaths caused by car accidents over 12000 deaths caused by accidental falls over 5000 deaths caused by firesover 4500 deaths due to accidental poisonings 5254 deaths from drowningthe rate of accidental gun deaths has also been decreasing  in 1970 it was 12 per 100000 in 1983 it was 7 per 100000 remember that about 40 of firearms accidents are hunting accidents  this means that the alreadylow accidental gun death rate is reduced even further when one considers just gun accidents in the home       in 1985 the accidental gun death rate in the house was only 3 per 100000 peoplemeaning that there was a total of 800 fatalities  criminals dont wait why should you    in much of the propaganda in support of a national waiting period it is  alleged that if such a waiting periodbackground check been in place john  hinckley would have been caught because he lied on a federal form when he  purchased the revolver used in his attack on president reagan    it is further claimed that hinckley would have been in jail instead of on his way to washington dc had such a background check been conducted    these allegations are irrefutably false    john hinckley purchased a total of eight firearms  two 38 cal and four 22  cal revolvers as well as two rifles  from august 1979 to january 1981 the 22 cal revolver used in his assault on president reagan was one of the two he purchased in october 1980 more than six months before he left for washington dc federal law was diligently complied with by the firearms dealer who filed  multiple purchase forms with the regional office of the bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms batf after the purchase    that purchase and all previous purchases were legal and they would have been legal under any waiting period scheme ever devised    at the time of his purchase and all previous purchases up until his attack on the president john hinckley had no felony record he had no recorded history  of mental illness or commitment no check involves police inspection of private conversations with a psychiatrist and he was using a valid texas drivers  license issued may 23 1979 to make his firearms purchases    the contention that a background check would have uncovered the fact that he  did not physically reside at the address listed on his drives license is a  willful distortion of the criminal record check made by local police to the  contrary had a check been run and all criminal records been thorough and  completely available they would have confirmed that he was not a prohibited person and that his last known address was lubbock texas and he was listed in the telephone directory    simply put no detection system ever proposed or ever devised has mindreading  capabilities advocates of the background check do a gross disservice to the  nation by distorting the truth no regulatory gun control scheme would have  prevented hinckley in his determination to carry out the tragic assassination  attempt on president reagan    the hinckley situation turns out to be typical in publicized shootings laurie  dann who shot several school children in illinois despite an extensive record of psychiatric problems and police investigations had never been committed to  an institution nor prosecuted for a felony her handgun purchases had been approved following an illinois background check for a permit to own and a  waiting period before each handgun acquisition and patrick purdy the mass  murderer in the stockton schoolyard had been able to purchase handguns  lawfully in california despite a 15day day waiting period and background check because his numerous felony arrests had all  been reduced to misdemeanor pleabarginings the leniency of the criminal justice system allowed him to be  on the streets following a 45 jail sentence for misusing a gun and resisting  arrest despite a probation report noting that he posed a danger to himself and others  promises doomed to fail    waiting periods fail to reduce crime yet that failure is used as an excuse to  impose more restrictive laws for example beginning with two days in 1940  moving to three days in 1958 and to five days in 1965 californias waiting  period was raised to 15 days in 1976 a longer minimum time than any other  state but this gradual increase in the waiting period has not reduced crime  between 1965 and 1987 the rate of violent crime per 100000 persons rose 235    yet the failure of the current law was used in 1982 as an argument for passage  of the illconceived and illfated proposition 15  the handgun freeze and  registration initiative california voters saw through this deception and soundly defeated this proposition by nearly a 2 to 1 margin    similarly and ironically while antigunners nationally were citing marylands waiting period as being effective in preventing numerous sales the vast  majority of appeals of denials were granted indicating that the system was  considerably more effective at disarming the lawabiding than at disarming criminals maryland gun control advocates insisted that the waiting period  wasnt keeping criminals from getting handguns and that a ban on the  manufacture and sale of certain handguns was needed    while insulting good and honest citizens the waiting period scheme will not  keep guns out of the hands of criminals nor will it prevent crimes of  passion indeed according to prominent antigun scholars philip j cook and  james blose of duke university ineligible people are less likely to submit to this screening process than are eligible people  because these people find  ways of circumventing the system entirely  the annals may 1981     that criminals do not obtain their firearms through retail channels was also  confirmed by a survey of felons conducted by profs james wright and peter  rossi of the university of massachusetts who concluded that retail sales play  a minor and unimportant role as direct sources of criminals handguns    inaccurate and outofdate records make citizens more apt than criminals to be  denied permits a recent study by the office of technology assessment an arm  of congress found that almost half of a sample of criminal history records  that the fbi sent to the police state agencies banks and other such  institutions throughout the united states were incomplete or inaccurate such inaccuracies could well lead to the denial of licenses to thousands of  reputable citizens under a federal registration and licensing system    ironically a chicago newspaper in 1983 submitted six illinois licensing  applications forms to the state in the names of such characters as bank robber  john dillenger and cuban revolutionary che guevara although illinois has  computerized registers which are checked in the course of handgun licensing  investigations all the applications were approved except for vito the godfather corleone whose bogus form included a photograph of actor marlon  brando in his film role    a waiting period scheme redirects police from crime fighting to the unrewarding task of snooping into the private lives of lawabiding citizens buying guns  through licensed firearms dealers  such crime control schemes merely make our streets  and homes  safer for criminals plying their nefarious trades  a november 1982 us news amp world report cover story on crime included an  article on the police subtitled its no wonder the forces in blue dont  catch more crooks  their budgets continue to get tighter and society keeps  giving them extra chores the article went on to note that only 45 officers  are actually on patrol in the streets out of every 100 on duty at a given time and the article pointed out that other studies have shown that police spend  only about 15 of their time dealing with violent crime  a waiting  periodbackground check is a perfect example of such diversion of police  activity    yet waiting periods have been softpeddled as fair and reasonable preventive moderate and acceptable to sportsmen nothing could be further from the truth  this is a proposal to be taken seriously what do these words actually mean  fair and reasonable    purely and simply waiting periods begin the step by step process where the  second amendment right to keep and bear arms becomes a privilege granted the  wealthy and influential    under the waiting period licensing procedures prospective gun owners are  presumed to be guilty of crime until a police check into their background  proves their innocence such a presumption is repellent to angloamerican  jurisprudence    background checks invite serious violations of the right to privacy indeed  since most persons who seek psychiatric assistance are not legally  institutionalized a thorough background check would require the opening of  hitherto private medical records to the police and the leading proponents  would even extend curbs to those with records of arrest followed by acquittal  for minor traffic violations or even using a gun in selfdefense    ironically at the same time when there is already uncertainty about the  propriety of the fbi keeping computerized records in the national crime  information center on anyone who might possibly be a criminal the waiting  period would set into motion a system of records on lawabiding citizens who  comply with the waiting period law such record keeping amounts to de facto registration awaiting only a central computer processing capability for  complete gun registration in virginia cities california illinois and  pennsylvania authorities are using waiting periods to establish such a system    waiting period schemes impose additional undue burdens on the lawabiding  citizen they force the applicant to take time off from his job make repeated  trips to a licensed firearms dealer to legally purchase a firearm and to pay  for the inconvenience since the additional paper work costs to the dealers are  passed along to the consumer    and a waiting periodbackground check costs the citizens of the state  tremendous amounts of money for useless bureaucratic paper work and  investigation a study by cook and blose the annuls may 1981 found that the  fbis regulations require any background investigation request be accompanied  by a set of finger prints and that the state criminal records bureau conduct a  check prior to the id divisions search and the current turnaround time for fbi searches is 22 working days based on these features they determined that a  fbi check is to costly and time consuming    in addition waiting periods encourage obstruction by the issuing authority in jurisdictions with waiting periods on the books there are countless cases of  lost applications petty harassments requiring repeated trips to different  offices for completion of paperwork fingerprinting and bureaucratic red tape designed to discourage gun ownership     in new jersey a frequently cited state by antigunners for one year police  refused to issue any permits because the fbi was refusing to do fingerprint  checks on civil matters authorities there regularly take 90 days  and occasionally much longer  to process an application even though the statute  requires it be done within 30 days moreover thousands of applications have been rejected simply because the police didnt want a citizen to have a  handgun even though there was no criminal or mental record to justify  rejection under the law this is similar to broward county florida where a  large percentage of rejected applications were based on traffic citations  rather than valid bases for denials    such discretionary power by police is opposed by the american people because it is abhorrent in a society built on freedom in a nationwide survey by decision  making information inc in 1978 the question was asked would you favor or  oppose a law giving the police the power to decide who may own a firearm by a margin of more than 21 the public was found to be against the power police  inevitably acquire through waiting periodlicensing legislation the us  senate reflected the will of the people in 1985 rejecting a waiting period by  a 31 margin  a crime prevention tool    almost half the states  including 64 percent of the population  require background checkswaiting periods on all handgun transfers but  according to cook and blose there has been no convincing empirical  demonstration that a police check on handgun buyers reduces violent crime  rates the annuals may 1981 indeed a comparison of states with added or  extended waiting periods from 1965 to 1987 reveals the ineffectiveness of such crime control experiments see table b    based on the 1987 fbi uniform crime reports there would appear to be an  inverse relationship between gun availability and violent crime data from the  state with the greatest number of local jurisdictions with waiting periods  andor licensing requirements  virginia  make clear waiting periods andor licensing have no impact even  allowing for the urban nature

expressed  florida law enforcements assessment of waiting periods and background checks  i think any working policeman will tell you that the crooks already have guns if a criminal fills out an applicationhes the biggest dumbest crook ive  ever seen in 1987 the florida state legislature subsequently repealed all  background check ordinances in the state     indeed a study of waiting periods by professors joseph p magaddino and  marshall h medoff of california state university at long beach found them to  be totally useless in curbing crime    their finding reconfirmed the results of multiple regression analyses by  matthew dezee of florida state university who favors restrictive gun laws and by douglas murray of the university of wisconsin they found that waiting  periods either alone or in combination with other gun laws were not effective in reducing violent crime or gun related criminal violence    even antigunners generally fail to claim crime control effects for waiting  periods instead citing statistics on the number of lawful handgun transfers  denied by state authorities they fail to cite drops in crime or to pretend  those denied lawful access to handguns do not acquire handguns by other means or use other weapons to commit crimes and despite allegations that those  denied are criminals caught by a background check only a fraction of a  percent of the time are such denials accompanied by so much as a recommendation for prosecution by claiming that denials show that the law is working the  other side would logically think a denial of 100 of applications was 100  effective  but not at stopping crime  prevents crimes of passion    proponents contend waiting periods will sharply reduce the number of handgun  murders committed annually this information is based on misconstrued and  outdated fbi data showing 70 percent of all murders involve people who know  each other  relatives friends acquaintances or neighbors    these fbi categories are misleading acquaintances can be as harvard professor mark moore has said old but familiar enemies neighbors is defined on the  basis of where people live not whether the are friends enemies or strangers  and predatory felonies are often committed in criminals neighborhood the area is familiar escape is easy the criminal doesnt stand out as he might in a  socially or racially different environment and he can count on fear of  retaliation to limit cooperation of victims or witnesses with the police it  was noted for example that 80 of washington dcs murders involved  acquaintances  and the crimes all involved drug trafficking    it must be emphasized that murder including domestic and acquaintance  murder is for the most part not committed by decent lawabiding citizens  catalyzed into murders by the presence of firearms     indeed fbi uniform crime reports detailing the characteristics of murders  until 1975 studies by the chicago police the senate subcommittee on  juvenile delinquency and the annual homicide analysis by the new york city  police show that 70  80 percent of suspected murders have criminal careers of long standing there have been an average of six arrests per suspect half of  them for violent crimes victims have similar records about 50 percent of the  time    waiting periods are further based on the false assumption that newly purchased  firearms are used in murders and other violent crimes yet the police  foundations firearm abuse 1977 found that only 21 percent of handguns  traced to all crime were less than a month old and a month is twice as long as any states waiting period    in fact an analysis by james d wright of the university of massachusetts  more suggests that 70 to 80 percent of gun purchasers already own firearms  in the  unlikely event that these individuals would chose to commit a violent crime a waiting period would be irrelevant    in addition the most frequent time for argumentprecipitated murders is during the time from 10 pm to 3 am time frame when gun shops are closed and  studies by the fbi and new york city police department nypd indicate that  about 50 percent of murderers are under the influence of alcohol andor drugs  at the time of the murder  conditions under which the sale of firearms is  already prohibited by law    waiting periods assume that violent people deprived of ready access to a  handgun will not kill yet dr marvin wolfgang the noted criminologist who  studied homicide in philadelphia and published patterns in criminal homicide found that the nature of homicide had little to do with the presence or absence of firearms he noted it is the contention of this observer that few  homicides due to shootings would be avoided merely if a firearm were not  immediately present and that the offender would select some other weapon the  achieve the same destructive goal probably only in those cases where a felon  kills a police officer or vise versa would homicide be avoided in the absence of a firearm    crimes of passion bring into play the plethora of curious objects used to  commit murder from brooms to ceramic lamps and especially knives according  to a list of murder weapons used in san francisco and new york between 1973 and 1983     the waiting period supposes that the crime of passion is some sudden impulse  which will pass but a nation institute of justice nij study reveals that the victims of family violence often suffer repeated problems from the same person  for months or even years and if not successfully resolved such incidents can eventually result in serious injury or death indeed a study conducted in  kansas city indicates that in 90 percent of spouse slaying there had been at  least one prior police call regarding wife beating and in 50 percent of such  murders police had been called at least 5 times of course part of the problem is that arrests are seldom made on such calls although recent research shows  that arrests coupled with support for the victim may reduce repeated  beatings    the tragic murder of john lennon and the assassination attempt on president  reagan renewed the cry for stricter waiting periods ironically lennons  murder purchased his gun in hawaii a state requiring permits to purchase  registration and banning the socalled saturday night special almost six  weeks before committing the crime and president reaganss assailant john  hinckley could have legally purchased firearms under a waiting period scheme  acceptable to sportsmen    already strict gun laws are placed on the nations 60 million lawobedient  firearms owners under the gun control act of 1968 gca 68 which requires  licensing of manufactures importers and dealers prohibits almost all  interstate transfers of handguns and requires interstate transfers of rifles  and shotguns to be through licensed dealers and in compliance with the laws of the states where the dealers operates and where the buyer resides and even  prohibits relatives from giving firearms to family members living in different  states prohibits the sale of arms or ammunition by a dealer or anyone else to or the acquisition or transportation by felons persons under felony  indictment fugitives drug addicts mental incompetents illegal aliens dishonorably discharged veterans those who have renounced their us  citizenship and employees of all such persons requires licensees to keep  records available for batf inspection prohibits receipt or possession of guns  by convicts dishonorably discharged veterans illegal aliens the insane  persons who have renounced their citizenship and prohibits the importation of many firearms and parts from abroad    yet these laws have failed to reduce crime which is much higher than when the gca 68 took effect the solution according to gun control fanatics is to  impose even more restrictive laws on the lawabiding    a current proposal would have the federal government ask local authorities to  run background checks in seven days with all the costs to be borne by local  departments with the added risk of federal prosecution if the local police  retained the application in their files and with no standards for approval or  denial and no provision for appeal     in addition handgun control inc has promised to sue any municipality if  police fail to prevent a transfer because they did not conduct a through enough background investigation and the handgun was then used in a crime handgun  control inc has claimed to have won at least one such case in the  philadelphia area where there is a waiting period and police conduct background checks    clearly restrictive gun laws only penalize the nations lawabiding firearms  owners for the violent acts committed by a small number of criminals who commit a disproportionately large number of crimes and regrettably gun control in any form diverts and wastes scarce resources which could instead be used to  support genuine crime control measures    the only effect of a waiting period is to deny someone the ability to defend  himself or herself  in san leandro california a female single parent was  forced to endure 15 days of terror at the hands of a maniacal neighbor while  she awaited the completion of the background check  the day after she was allowed to pick up her handgun she killed her attacker with it    statistically a waiting period would seem more likely to interfere with the  estimated 650000 citizens who use handguns for protection each year than the  roughly 100000 criminals who repeatedly misuse handguns  generally acquired  by theft or from fences drug dealers and the black market    yet the wrightrossi study found that three quarters of the convicted felons  were able to get their most recent handgun within a day  despite long  criminal records    as the wall street journal noted shortly after the lennon murder  the  sudden hue and cry for more gun control at such times is a kind of  copout  the sort of copout that is part of the crime problem in america    the country knows there is something wrong too many are turning to crimes of  violence the notion that this can be changed by controlling guns we worry  may be an excuse for avoiding the hard work of making our decrepit criminal  justice system start to function and the even harder work of buttressing what  used to be called the nations moral fiber  sentence the criminal    it is clear that the way to curb violent crime is to punish the criminal  studies suggest that 75  85 percent of urban violence is perpetrated by career criminals and 30  35 percent of robbery and murder is committed by persons on some form of conditional release  bail probation suspended sentence to  combat crime america must address this problem of recidivism and the revolving door system of justice    over a ten year period after the 1975 adoption of a mandatory penalty for using a firearm to commit a violent crime virginias homicide rate fell 356 percent and robbery declined 236 percent a 1974 arizona law saw homicide fall 218  percent and robbery 322 percent while the west south central region of the  united states saw robbery rise 322 percent respectively a 1975 arkansas  mandatory penalty statute viewed a 247 percent decrease in homicide and a 97  more percent decrease in robbery south carolina recorded an astounding 367 percent decrease in homicide and 88 percent decrease in robbery after adopting a  mandatory penalty    clearly instead of imposing further penalties  in the form of waiting  periods and additional assaults on the civil rights of lawabiding gun owners  and gun purchasers the proper approach is to implement mandatory punishment  for the criminal abuser of firearms    the violent crime rate has decreased in part since 1980 because the number of  persons in american prisons has increased from 315000 in 1980 to 514133 in  1986    the remedy or any  appropriate penalty must be after the commission of an  offense if the presumption of innocence is to be preserved indeed if  democracy itself is to survive    printed from nra publication il3n1064 the case against waiting periods     rkba016  is the united states the most violent nation            version 11 last changed on 910321 at 230558    description    a spate of media claims implying that the united states is the highest crime nation in the world has been observed in the media recently however if we were to look at homicide rape and larceny burgalry robbery etc we find a quite different story    in homicide the us is number 11 with a murder rate of 960 per 100000 the nearest european country in the netherlands with a homicide rate of 715 per 100000 however elimination of high crime inner city rates pushes the per capita down to 377 below such countries as luxemburg 525 finland 488 west germany 447 scotland 382 and somewhat barely above sweden 336    places such as norway are not known to have massive illegal aliens drug misuse problems or large cultural inhomogeneities    of even more interest is the tremendously larger per capita rape numbers in the nonviolent peace loving european counties the unites states at 2630 is below such countries as australia 9082 west germany 7749 new zealand 6573 netherlands 5600 scotland 4469 denmark 4106 sweden 4052 austria 3042    in the category of larceny robbery burglary etc the united states is below italy and new zealand and somewhat above denmark west germany scotland sweden austria and england amp wales       conclusion    the united states is not the most violent country in the world while high in homicide there are several european nations that have similar per capita homicide rates without the presence of large scale drug problems or immigrant amp illegal alien situations    in terms of rape the us lags tremendously behind some of the civilized and nonviolent european countries    in larceny burglary robbery the us is again not a leader    in short given all the problems that the us has that european countries do not have the us is surprisingly nonviolent relatively speaking                     h o m i c i d

recently mentioned the second amendment in dicta in united states v verdugourquidez 110 s ct 1839 1990 verdugourquidez was a citizen and resident of mexico and a drug dealer  the mexican police arrested him in mexico and brought him to the us where the us cops arrested him  with the permission of the mexican police the us narcs searched his residence in mexico and found documentary evidence detailing drug shipments to the us  verdugourquidez moved for suppression of that evidence as a violation of the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures    the question for the court  does the fourth amendment apply to nonresident noncitizens outside the us  the answer  no    the courts reasoning  the fourth amendment protects the right of the people to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures  who are the people  according to chief justice rehnquist the phrase the people was a term of art used by the framers  rehnquist wrote         the second amendment protects the right of the people      to keep and bear arms and the ninth and tenth      amendments provide that certain rights and powers are      retained by and reserved to the people  see also      us const amdt 1 congress shall make no law       abridging  the right of the people peaceably to      assemble art i s 2 cl 1 the house of      representatives shall be composed of members chosen      every second year by the people of the several states      emphasis added  while this textual exegesis is by no      means conclusive it suggests that the people      protected by the fourth amendment and by the first and      second amendments and to whom rights and powers are      reserved in the ninth and tenth amendments refers to a      class of persons who are part of a national community      or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection      with this country to be considered part of that      community  110 s ct at 1061    since verdugourquidez is not part of the people he is not protected by the fourth amendments nor apparently by the first second ninth or tenth    the supreme court therefore views the words the people in the second amendment to have the same meaning as in the first fourth ninth and tenth amendments  if the people really meant the right of states to maintain a militia as suggested by j sultan then we would be left with the absurd notion that only the states have the right to peaceably assemble only the states have the right to be secure in their persons and property etc  the supreme courts position is indisputable  the second amendment protects the individual right to bear arms also instructive is the report of the subcommittee on the constitution of the committee on the judiciary united states senate 97th congress second session february 1982         the conclusion is thus inescapable that the history      concept and wording of the second amendment to the      constitution of the united states as well as its      interpretation by every major commentator and court in      the first halfcentury after its ratification      indicates that what is protected is an individual right      of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a      peaceful manner    this hardly supports j sultans premise that an individual right is universally unaccepted    antigunners frequently use the big lie technique referred to by d malbuff to the effect that the supreme court has consistently ruled that the second amendment does not apply to individual citizens it only protects the right of the national guard to go duck hunting  here is a nutshell history of supreme court rulings on the second amendment    united states v miller 307 us 174 1939  mr miller was a very bad dude charged with a laundry list of heinous crimes they threw the book at him including carrying a sawedoff shotgun a violation of the national firearms act of 1934  when his case came up before the supreme court miller had skipped he was a fugitive  no lawyer appeared to argue his side of the case only the government lawyers showed up  some fair trial huh  now if the second amendment only protected the state militia the case would have been easy  all the court would have had to do was say that miller could not own a gun because he was not a member of the militia end of discussion  but they didnt say that  why not  in effect they conceded that the second amendment protects an individual right but still said that it was constitutional for the government to prohibit sawedoff shotguns  their reasoning         certainly it is not within judicial notice that this      weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment      or that its use could contribute to the common defense    there are three interesting things about the courts statement first of course it was not in their notice nobody was present to bring it to their notice  second had a knowledgeable advocate been present he would have brought to the courts notice that shortbarrelled shotguns have long been used as ordinary military equipment from revolutionary war blunderbusses to luparas in the spanishamerican war to trenchcleaners in the war to end all wars  subsequently us troops used sawedoff shotguns in world war ii and tunnel rats used them in vietnam    third and most important is that the court seems to be saying that the second amendment only protects the right of individual citizens to have ordinary military equipment  very interesting  what are semiautomatic assault rifles if not ordinary military equipment  when californias assault rifle ban reaches the supreme court miller will present a real problem for the antigunners    there are no other supreme court cases in the 20th century but there are dozens of state cases that support the individual right to bear weapons not sporting goods  see for example state v swanton 129 ariz 131 ct app 1981 the term arms as used means such arms as are recognized in civilized warfare        state v kessler 289 or 359 1980 the terms arms most likely would include only the modern day equivalents of the weapons used by colonial militiamen    also    state ex rel city of princeton v buckner 377 se 2d 139 wva 1988 barnett v state 72 or app 585 1985 state v delgado 298 or 395 1984 city of lakewood v pillow 180 colo 20 1972 city of las vegas v moberg 82 nm 626 ct app 1971    and dozens more    there were few if any gun control laws on the books until after the civil war  then suddenly every southern state had a law prohibiting newlyfreed slaves from owning guns  guess why  it was getting damned dangerous for the klansmen to lynch blacks the fourteenth amendment rendered those black codes unconstitutional so the southerners figured out some backdoor methods  one was banning cheap guns the term saturday night special has its origin in the racial slur niggertown saturday night which was similar to fathers day in harlem or chinese fire drill  another was a permit systemwaiting period background check requiring approval of the sheriff who usually just happened to be a klansman    united states v cruikshank 92 us 542 1876  in louisiana a hundred or so good old boys got word that there were some uppity niggers having an organizational meeting to try to protect themselves against constant attacks by white gangs  the good old boys got together and crashed the party  they took away the negroes guns and then proceeded to murder them  they were charged with conspiring to deprive their victims of their constitutional rights to assemble and to bear arms    the court ruled that 1 the first and second amendments did not apply to the states 2 the fourteenth amendment only prohibited the state from depriving the people of their rights and the good old boys were not agents of the state and 3 the controlling enforcement acts protected only those rights granted by the constitution  the court said that the rights to assemble and to bear arms were fundamental rights  they were not granted by the constitution but were inalienable they were rights with which the victims were endowed by their creator  therefore the rights were not protected by the enforcement acts and the kkk boys literally got away with murder  this is a case proudly cited by people who call themselves liberals instead of the racist scum that they really are    presser v illinois 116 us 252 1886  presser had organized a society of german immigrants lehr und wehr verein who believed that regular military drill was an important part of good citizenship  four hundred of them paraded through downtown chicago carrying rifles  presser was charged with parading without a license and organizing and maintaining a private army he claimed that the illinois statutes violated his rights under the first amendment freedom of assembly and the second amendment right to bear arms  the court ruled that the bill of rights applied only to the federal government not to the states and that any state could prohibit free speech free exercise of religion assembly bearing of arms etc    in presser the court never mentioned the individual right to bear arms the case dealt only with an armed organization    miller v texas 153 us 535 1894  texas had a law forbidding the carrying of weapons and authorizing arrest without warrant for any violation  miller claimed this violated the second amendment and the fourth amendment  the court again ruled that the restrictions of this amendments operate only upon the federal power  but they admitted that it was possible that the fourteenth amendment might cause the bill of rights to apply to the states as well  however miller did not raise his objection early enough  if the fourteenth amendment limited the power of the states as to such rights    we think it was fatal to this claim that it was not set up in the trial court  id at 538    subsequent to cruikshank presser and miller v texas the court ruled that the fourteenth amendment does in fact cause the bill of rights to apply to the states  in effect those three cases have been invalidated  to believe otherwise is to believe that the states can restrict religion speech and assembly to execute unreasonable searches and seizures to deny jury trials or to infringe the right to bear arms    an important note  the court never doubted for an instant that the right to bear arms was not an individual right which the federal government could not infringe  these cases never talked about the second amendment being a right of states to organize militias  it has always been assumed that the right to bear arms is a right of individual citizens to bear arms perhaps the supreme courts most infamous decision was dred scott v sandford 60 us 19 how 393 1857  chief justice taney said that negroes could not be citizens because if they were they would have the right to vote to assemble to speak on political subjects to travel freely and to keep and carry arms wherever they went  id at 417  taney the classic racist found that prospect inconceivable  it is noteworthy though that the supreme court considered the right to carry guns wherever they go an individual right of every citizen along with voting speaking assembling  nor can congress deny the people the right to keep and bear arms nor the right to trial by jury nor compel anyone to be a witness against himself     id at 450  obviously the people refers to all citizens not the states or militia or the rest of the sentence becomes meaningless  see verdugourquidez supra    what the second amendment protects is an individual right to bear military weapons not for hunting not for target shooting not for repelling foreign invaders but for the purpose of preventing oppression of the people by their own government  the historical textual structural doctrinal prudential judicial and legislative evidence is devastating  sultans claim that this is universally unaccepted is as ludicrous as saddam husseins claim of victory over the great satan    any intelligent person who wishes to study the matter seriously should begin with s levinson the embarrassing second amendment 99 yale lj 637  professor levinson university of texas is a devout liberal as am i who set out to prove once and for all that the second amendment does not protect an individual right etc ad nauseam per sultan  to his great embarrassment hence the title he found overwhelming evidence to the contrary  he had the academic integrity to admit it for which he deserves great admiration  he does not like gun ownership any more than some people like flagburning or organized religion but he recognizes that the individual right exists whether one likes it or not  rkba015  are firearms a leading cause of death of children            version 11 last changed on 910315 at 122118    description    in some recent and lurid accounts in the media the claim has been advanced that the leading cause of death among children is firearms some variations of this claim state that is the leading cause of death of young black males    well this just does not sound right in turning to factual sources i am hampered by not having information that is up to date as i like however rather than wait i have decided to post the information i do have which in terms of completeness is based on 1985 data    i have checked 1990 data which only gives death counts on a per capita basis without segragation by age groups however there are no significant changes in the per capita ratios which is a very strong indication that the 1985 figures can be rationally extrapolated    as later information is available i will update this posting       in 1985    27607 children ages under 18 died    11927 children died from all accidents     6639 children died in motor accidents     1613 children died by drowning     1249 children died from fires andor burns     1445 children died from miscellaneousother causes       637 children died from firearms        429 children died from accidents involving firearms        208 children ages 14 and under were murdered by firearms    an additional 888 children ages 15 through 19 were murdered by firearms    the breakdown in homicides group in 5 year groups and the group 1519 spans what is clearly a childs age 1516 and 17 and ages that are not children    summary      of the 27607 deaths of children lt 18 in 1985 637 children died from firearms both accidents and homicides yet ten times more children 6639 died in motor accident alone there is absolutely no way that firearms even begin to approach being a leading cause of death for children    current incomplete 1990 statistics show that the percentages are still the same  5    conclusion    firearms are clearly not by any stretch of the imagination a leading cause of death for children ages 18 and under in facts firearms are involved both homicide and accidents in only 23 of deaths of children                      deaths by age by major causes                                                                  s       p t              a d                                       u       o h              c e

buddies  after a night at their favorite bar they head back to jims trailer for some whiskey  jim begins praising his new girlfriend  bob questions her fidelity and claims that he has slept with her  seized by uncontrollable rage jim grabs a loaded 44 from the kitchen drawer and ends the conversation with a bang       this is the sort of scenario that most people probably imagine when they hear that the majority of murders involve individuals who knew each other before the crime  based on this impression guncontrol advocates argue that most homicides do not involve murderous intent  rather they are committed in the heat of the moment in disputes or altercations among loved ones or close associates that escalate into rage  disputes that turn fatal not so much because anyone intended to kill but because in that lamentable fit of anger a gun was at hand  and if that is really how most murders happen it follows that if fewer guns were at hand fewer murders would be committed      but the data on relationships between homicide victims and their killers tell a different story  the conclusion in favor of gun control simply does not follow from the evidence      fbi figures for 1987 and 1988 reveal that murders by strangers  for example in the course of a robbery  are rare  they account for only about one in eight homicides 126 percent  but this does not imply that the remaining seven in every eight homicides involve loved ones slaying one another  after all very few people love everyone they meet  just how close is the relationship between victim and killer in the typical murder      in many cases  nearly a third of the total  the authorities simply cannot determine the relationship  next to unknown the largest relationship category is acquaintance  accounting for approximately one additional third of the murders  you might think that acquaintance refers to fairly close associates but the fbi tallies neighbors friends boyfriends girlfriends and all types of relatives in their own separate categories  it there were any degree of intimacy or closeness between acquaintances the fbi would almost certainly classify the homicide under another heading  in this context acquaintance means only that the victim and killer had some idea of each others identities before the murder      all categories of relatives combined account for about one in six murders 159 percent o average  about half of these are slayings of spouses by spouses  friends and neighbors add an average of 98 percent to the homicide total  altogether then relatives friends and neighbors commit only about a quarter 257 percent of murders  so its not true that most murders involve persons who share some degree of intimacy or closeness  most murders  some threequarters of them  are committed by casual acquaintances 302 percent perfect strangers 128 percent or persons unknown 312 percent      gun control advocates however can easily convey the opposite impression of these data  by simply omitting the unknown relationships from the calculation and including casual acquaintances within the category of intimates they can make it seem as if every murder other than those by perfect strangers involve intimates  but given what the category of acquaintance specifically omits this would be an irresponsible misrepresentation      that most murder victims know their killers prior to the crime is scarcely a surprise  that people know one another is not in itself evidence that they like one another  ordinarily the only people a murderer would have good reasons to kill would be people he or she knows indeed slayings in the course of some other felony are the only obvious exception  random killings are understandably quite rare  so contrary to the common assumption some degree of prior acquaintance between victim and offender definitely does not rule out murderous intent      cases of family members slaying one another figure prominently in the gun control debate but represent fewer than onesixth of all murders studies of family homicide have shown that most of these families about 85 percent of them have had previous domestic quarrels serious enough to bring the police to the residence in nearly half of the cases the police had been called to the residence five or more times before the killing occurred  indeed most of the families in which such homicides occur have histories of abuse and violence going back years or even decades  these slayings are generally not isolated outbursts of rage between normally placid and loving couples  they are instead the culminating episodes in long violent abusive family relations      at least some family homicides probably do result from the stereotypical moment of rage  others result from a thoroughly willful intention to kill knowing only that victim and killer are related by blood or marriage does not in itself tell us which explanation is correct for a given homicide      consider the bizarre case of theron and leila morris a florida couple recently accused of killing their son christopher  police say the morrises were plotting with their son to murder his exwife for her insurance money  then the conspirators learned that the exwifes insurance policy had lapsed so there was nothing to be gained in killing her  evidently annoyed by this turn of events the morrises then allegedly plotted between themselves to kill christopher in order to collect on his insurance policy which was still in force and worth twice what his exwifes policy was worth  the associated press reported that the parents were also angry with morris because he had sold them bogus cocaine for 1000 that they had intended to resell      morriss killing will appear in the fbis 1990 uniform crime report tabulation as a family homicide  having been slain by his own parents he will be included in the category son  what then will we know about the circumstances of his death given that he was the child of his killers  nothing at all      how many murders are committed in a moment of rage brought to fruition largely because a gun was available and how many result from an unambiguous intention to kill  the fact is nobody knows the answer to this question  an adequate answer would require getting inside the heads of murders as they contemplate and commit their crimes      clearly though the assumption that heatofthemoment murders far outnumber willful murders cannot be justified by evidence on prior victimoffender relationships  such information does not support conclusions about homicidal motives or about the number of slayings that might be prevented if fewer guns were available  date wed 5 sep 90 130749 pdt    gun week reports in its august 31 issue that homicides in portland oregon have fallen as concealed carry permits increased rapidly            in the first seven months of 1990 2200 permits         to carry a concealed weapon have been issued  only         17 such permits were issued in all of 1989         homicide has fallen 33 in the first six months         of 1990 in portland measured against the same         period last year    in the same article  allan gottlieb notes that homicides increased 9 percent over the same period in baltimore md which has a ban on saturday night specials  he also notices that homicides have increased 45 percent this year in new york city  there you are three times more likely to be murdered than die in an automobile accident  new york has a virtual ban on handgun possession by lawabiding citizens    the decrease in homicides in portland is the second largest in the country  the article does not tell the first largest decrease or the source of the source of the homicide numbers    oregon recently liberalized its ccw system to remove arbitrary police discretion in the issuance of permits typically the difference in wording is shall versus may be issued a permit  i believe they got this in exchange for a waiting period on handgun purchases  an examination of the leading principles of the federal constitution by n webster philadelphia 1787 pages 41 to 43    41  but what is tyranny  or how can a free people be deprived of their liberties  tyranny is the exercise of some power over a man which is not warranted by law or necessary for the public safety  a people can never be deprived    42  of their liberties while they retain in their own hands a power superior to any other power in the state  this position leads me directly to enquire in what consists the power of a nation or of an order of men    in some nations legislators have derived much of their power from the influence of religion or from the implicit belief which an ignorant an superstitious people entertain of the gods and their interposition in every transaction of life  the roman senate sometimes availed themselves of this engine to carry their decrees and maintain their authority  this was particularly the case under the aristocracy which succeeded the abolition of the monarchy  the augurs and priests were taken wholly from pa trician families   they constituted a distinct order of menhad power to negative any law of the people by declaring that it was passed during the taking of the auspices  this influence derived from the authority of opinion was less perceptible but as tyrannical as a military force  the same influence constitutes as this day a princical support of several governments on the eastern continent and perhaps in the south america  but in north america by a singular concurrence of circumstances the possibility of establishing this influence as a pillar of government is totally precluded    43  another source of power in government is a military force  but this to be efficient must be superior to any force that exists among the people or which they can command  for otherwise this force would be annihilated on the first exercise of acts of oppression  before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in europe  the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superiour to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretence raised in the united states  a military force at the command of congress can execute no laws but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional for they will possess the it power and jealousy will instantly inspire the it inclination to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive  in spite of all the nominal powers vested in congress by the constitution were the system once adopted in its fulest latitude still the actually exercise of them would be frequently interrupted by popular jealousy  i am bold to say that it ten just and constitutuional measures would be resisted where it one unjust or oppressive law would be enforced  the powers vested in congress are little more than it nominal nay it real power cannot be vested in them nor in any body but the it people  the source of power is in the it people of this country and cannot for ages and probably never will be removed    in what does it real power consist  the answer is short and plainin it property  could    he then continues on a discussion of the power of the government and that is basically the power of controlling property  you might also be interested to know how us law defines the militia    these sections are referred to as 10 usc 311    title 10armed forces section 311 militia composition and classes    a the militia of the united states consists of all ablebodied males at least 17 years of age and except as provided in section 313 of title 32 under 45 years of age who are or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the united states and of female citizens of the united states who are commissioned officers of the national guard  b the classes of the militia are  1 the organized militia which consists of the national guard         and the naval militia and  2 the unorganized militia which consists of the members of the militia         who are not members of the national guard or the naval militia  a summary of studies on gun use and gun control    o a study by the centre for disease control conducted in april 1985   showed that waiting periods have no effect on suicides    o a study reported in the annals of the american academy   of political science in may 1981 found that most felons   and other ineligibles who obtain guns do so not because   the states screening system fails to discern their   criminal record but rather because these people find   ways of circumventing the screening system entirely    o a 1985 justice department study showed that the primary   means of gun acquisition by felons is theft    o a university of massachusetts study found that most   criminals get their guns from other criminals    o states with waiting periods do not have lower crime rates  no waiting   period has ever been shown to have any effect on crime whatsoever    o since banning handguns in 1976 the homicide rate in the   district of columbia has risen 168 to 719  possibly   the highest rate ever for a large american city the gunrelated   homicide rate for the district has risen over   250 while falling nationally and regionally    o since the canadian firearms control act was brought in in 1978   the number of assaults with firearms in toronto has quadrupled    o only 180 homicides in canada involve firearms and about   160 of those involved illegal firearms    o in 1976 40 6 million canadians of canadian households   contained a firearm approximately 190000 firearms are   imported into canada in each year in july 1989 3 of   canadians owned a handgun in november 1990 the rate was 6    o fbi reports show that 85 of all firearms used in crimes   are obtained illegally    o in the usa the number of children under 12 killed as a   result of firearm accidents in the home is approximately   280 per year in comparison over 5000 children drown   every year in back yard swimming pools    o recordbreaking murder rates in washington dc new york   city and detroit are often given as examples of the need   for handgun control when in fact handguns are so   already strictly regulated in these cities as to be   practically banned in new york for example you must   obtain a permit from the police department before you can   take your handgun out of your home and even then you may   do so only twice in one year even if just for target   practice at a shooting range new york city enacted   strict firearms ownership regulations in 1968 but has   seen a 126 increase in the homicide rate and an increase   of 250 in the gunrelated crime rate    o  there is no evidence whatsoever showing that restriction   of handgun ownership is related in any way to violent   crime rates in the us in fact there appears to be   an direct relationship between strictness of gun laws and   the rate of violent crime in some communities where extremely   permissive gun laws grant permits to carry practically for the   asking violent crime rates have plummeted drastically    o in portland oregon in 1989 17 ccw carry concealed   weapon permits were issued in 1990 2500 ccw permits   were issued in 1990 the murder rate in portland dropped by 33    o in orlando florida in 1966 a series of brutal rapes   swept the community citizens reacted to the tripling in   the rate of rape over the previous year by buying   handguns for selfdefense 200300 firearms were being   purchased each week from dealers and an unknown number   more from private parties the newspaper there the   orlando sentinel star had an antigun editorial   stance and tried to pressure the local police chief and   city government to stop the flow of arms    when that tactic failed the paper decided that in the interest of public safety they would sponsor a guntraining seminar in conjunction with the local police  plans were made for a oneday training course at a local city park    plans were made for an expected 400500 women  however more than 2500 women arrived and brought with them every conceivable kind of firearm  they had to park many blocks away and the weapons were carried in in purses paper bags boxes briefcases holsters and womens hands  one police officer present said hed never been so scared in his life    swamped the organizers hastily dismissed the women with promises for a more thorough course with scheduled appointments  the course offered was for three classesweek and within 6 months the orlando police had trained more than 6000 women in basic pistol marksmanship and the law of selfdefense    the results       in 1966 there were 36 rapes in orlando triple the 1965 rate in 1967 there were 4  before the training rape rates had been increasing in orlando as nationwide five years after the training rape was still below pretraining levels in orlando but up 308 in the surrounding areas 96 for florida overall and 64 nationally    also in 1967 violent assault and burglary decreased by 25 in orlando in addition to the rape reductions    in 1967 not a single woman had fired her weapon in selfdefense in 1967 not a single woman had turned her gun on her husband or boyfriend no data are available for later years    the reason the program worked so spectacularly well is that it was widely known that orlando women had the means and training to defend themselves from attackers rapists being somewhat human they are learning engines they took their business elsewhereto the detriment of the defenseless in those other locations    o in florida since the gun laws have been modified to   allow women who qualify to carry a gun concealed the   reported rape rate has dropped by 90    o switzerland is a country with an assault weapon and   ammunition in almost every home yet there is very little crime    o japan has a total ban on civilian firearm ownership yet   in septoct 1990 in okinawa prefecture there were 28   shootings resulting in the deaths of several police   officers as reported in november 1990 japan today cbc newsworld    o a recent study in the us found that an individual was   much more likely to be a victim of violent crime in an   area with strict gun control laws than in an area with lax gun laws    o  last year about 25000 murders were committed in the   united states about 9000 of these were committed with   handguns this is in a country with 250000000 people   including 65000000 gun owners assuming that each of   the 9000 was committed by a different person they   represent approximately 17000th of the gun owners in that country    o us law enforcement statistics show that firearms were   used by private citizens in selfdefence to deter   prevent or stop a crime approximately 1000000 times   in 1989 this resulted in 1500 to 2800 justifiable   killings 015 to 028 and 8700 to 16600 nonfatal   legally permissible woundings 087  to 166 the   remaining 98 involved neither killings nor woundings   but rather warning shots fired or guns pointed or   referred to crime control through the private use of   armed force professor gary kleck feb 88 social problems    o us department of justice victim studies show that   overall when rape is attempted the completion rate is   36 but when a woman defends herself with a gun the   completion rate drops to 3 overall victimization   studies show that for all violent crimes including   assault rape and robbery the safest course for the   victim is to resist with a firearm the second safest   course is passive compliance with the attacker but this   tactic approximately doubles the probability of death or   injury for the victim all other tactics mace whistles   handtohand combat screams and so forth have even worse outcomes    o a florida state university study indicates that lawabiding   citizens use handguns approximately 645000   times a year in selfprotection with an additional   350000 selfdefense uses of rifles and shotguns for   thousands the possession and use of a firearm is the   difference between being the victim of a violent crime   and successfully thwarting a criminal attack    o  the concept of a cooling off period has no basis in   fact a kansas city study showed that in 90 of domestic   violence cases police had been called to the scene   several times before a police foundation study showed that only   2 of all handguns traced to crimes were less than a month old    o marc lapine was seen at the montreal university several   months before his murderous rampage which suggests he   planned his attack months in advance    o john hinckleywho shot former us president reagan and   james brady bought his firearm legally from a texas gun   store 5 months beforehand and also possessed several   other more powerful firearms he had been arrested   several days earlier for attempting to smuggle a firearm   aboard an airplane at that time a background check was   performed and as he had no criminal record he was able   to plead guilty pay a 6250 fine and was released    o the tefloncoated armourpiercing bullet does not   exist a company called ktw developed a teflontipped   bullet for penetrating car doors but when fired into   standard kevlar body armour it was even less effective   than ordinary bullets contrary to the claims of   fanatical antigun lobbyists who trumpeted that this   new bullet rendered cops helpless even with body   armour no police officer in the usa has been ever shot   with armour piercing handgun ammunition    ktw was setup in the early 1980s by police sergeant don ward police lieutenant turcus and scientist dr paul kopsch  they sold their ktw round to the military and a handful of police departments and have never sold it to the public    the nra helped draft the final legislation which was adopted which banned the sale of the ktw armorpiercing bullet to anyone but police and military organizations  the original legislation which the nra opposed would have banned any ammunition which could pierce a ballistic vest  that includes the smallest caliber 22 which can slip between the fibers of the kevlar vest it also includes most rifle ammunition but very little handgun ammunition    in short the legislation as proposed would have banned most calibers including ones like 270 winchester and 3030 which have been used since the turn of the century for hunting    o plastic guns that are invisible to airport xray   machines do not exist the only pistol on the market   today with any plastic parts is the glock and it is   approximately 70 metal 83 by weight and the high   strength polymer frame contains barium a similar pistol   is made by ramline but only in 22 calibre    the nra helped draft a bill which bans guns which can pass airport security mind you no such guns exist the gun which caused all the controversy the glock contains a large amount of metal and there is a metal polymer in the plastic portions which shows up on an xray machine     the glock is very reliable and has become the standard sidearm for a large number of law enforcement agencies across the country including if memory serves washington dc and parts of new york    one of the main proponents of the original legislation senator metzenbaum revealed his true opinion  when pressed he exclaimed i dont care about airport security i want to get the guns    o after lobbying by hysterical antigunners us government   legislation has been passed banning possession of   tefloncoated armourpiercing bullets and plastic   guns invisible to airport xray machines even though   neither of these has ever existed    o  there are approximately 247000 legally owned fully   automatic weapons assault rifles machine guns sub   machine guns in the usa according to the batf in the   years since 1934 none of these weapons has been used by   their legal owner in a criminal offence    o there are approximately 5000 legally owned fully   automatic weapons assault rifles machine guns   submachine guns in canada yet since 1934 none of these   weapons has been used by their legal owner in a criminal offence    o in a paper presented to the royal society in 1663 palmer   described the theory of operation used by modern machine   guns both recoil and gasoperated in 1718 puckle was   granted a patent on an automatic weapon multiplebarrel   weapons which palmers and puckles werent were   developed centuries earlier some of these earlier guns   also used a rather clever way of getting multiple shots   from the same barrel without reloading revolvers had   also been invented by the 1770s and the brits actually   used semiautos against the colonials    o bolt action and lever action rifles are convertible to   be fully automatic weapons at the turn of the century   john brownings first machine gun was converted from a   lever action rifle during world war one the factory in   canada converted the ross bolt action rifle into the huot   machine gun during world war two in new zealand 2000 lee enfield   bolt action rifles were converted into the charlton light machine gun    o in 1990 the state of florida faced with increasing   pressure to condemn assault weapons assembled a   commission to study the evidence and then issue a report   to the governor and legislature    the panel comprised of lawmakers citizens representatives from both pro and antigun groups and law enforcement officials spent several months examining data supplied by both state and federal law enforcement agencies the group also heard testimony from florida police officers who work within some of the regions worst criminal battle zones    early this spring the commission announced the results of their labors with the findings mirroring similar studies conducted by the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms batf  in summary the commission concluded that based on police reports actual testimony and statistics provided by federal agencies the use of assault weapons by criminals constituted only a fraction of a percent of types of firearms employed in felonious activity    the commission discovered that media hype and antigun advertising had created a sinister ambience around these firearms without actually clarifying what the guns were  the term assault weapon is generally defined as a military weapon capable of both semiautomatic and fully automatic fire  written testimony supplied to the commission indicated that fully automatic firearms were rarely if ever used by criminals  in fact there was no evidence that a licensed fully automatic firearm has ever been instrumental in a reported crime    the panel found that the term assault weapon as portrayed by the media referred to semiautomatics in general especially guns resembling militarystyle combat firearms  the resulting confusion made reporting by police officials difficult at best the commission determined  as a result they called for a clarified reporting system that would indicate the type make caliber and action of any firearm used in a crime      even with the confusion actual data available still indicated that use of semiautos by criminals was negligible  this supported batf findings nationwide that semiautomatic firearms were not 20 times more likely to be used in a crime and were not the weapon of choice of drug dealers  these assumptions have been advanced by antigun organizations have formed the basis of a discriminatory newspaper study and have often been echoed by media commentators    o the florida report in concert with federal studies   also found that stolen guns rather than overthecounter   purchases were most often employed by criminals some   antigun groups insist that florida gun shops are doing   a brisk trade supplying assault weapons to drug gangs   the commission found no evidence to support this accusation      in conclusion the commission could not uncover any reason to place restrictions upon the sale of semiautomatic firearms and determined that these guns posed no particular menace to law enforcement  instead they called for harsh mandatory sentences for the criminal misuse of firearms an end to pleabargaining in firearmsrelated crimes better reporting procedures in naming firearms used in crimes and an improved database to prohibit pointofpurchase sales and the issue of carry permits to individuals with a history of mental incompetency       o new jersey just enacted the most harsh assault weapon   ban in the country owning a bb gun is now felony   possession of an assault weapon according to the bill   a bb gun is capable of causing injury and often holds   more than 15 pellets none of the weapons banned had been   used in a criminal offence in new jersey in the previous 5 years    but contrary to what the media reported the police didnt want the favor the law enforcement community generally thought that gov james j florio went off the deep end by making the assault weapon ban his top priority    the new jersey chiefs of police voted against the bill 1971  the fraternal order of police testified against the bill the state legislature  the police benevolent association was persuaded to abstain on the issue after florio threatened to rescind a police benefits package that had recently been agreed to    o in washington dc there are a number of police   lobbies that do support assault weapon bans though   narrower than the new jersey one yet its not clear   that the lobbyists have the working police solidly behind them    o last year the national association of chiefs of police   conducted a poll of commandrank officers 69 percent   thought lawabiding citizens ought to have the right to   purchase any type of firearms 62 percent opposed a   federallymandated waiting period      a similar study of officers on the street found that   about 88 opposed gun bans and supported public ownership of firearms    yet handgun controls claim to have the active support of every major police organization for its gun prohibitions and waiting periods is dishonest the national sheriffs association the american federation of police and the national association of chiefs of police have refused to board the handgun control train    there is one group of police that generally does back more gun control  bigcity police chiefs and the organizations they run  their voice certainly deserves to be heard but too often the voices of other officers are silenced for example san jose calif police chief joseph mcnamara raises funds for handgun control on official city stationary and claims to represent the views of every law enforcement officer  but when rankandfile san jose officer leroy pile spoke out against gun control on his own time the chief had him suspended and tried to fire him    o in maryland during the 1988 election progun police   officers were forbidden to speak out against a gun   control proposal that was on the ballot maryland gun   control proponents including gov william donald   schaefer then claimed to be fighting for the law enforcement community o  los angeles police chief daryl gates has denounced   semiautos in which he asserted that their massive use   by criminals their excessive power their use in driveby   shootings and their easy convertibility to full   auto chief gates is now facing calls for his   resignation as a result of the videotaped beating of a   black man by several white officers    o at the same time the lapd ballistics expert produced   evidence that such firearms accounted for about 3 percent   of crime guns were difficult if not impossible in most   cases to convert and were almost never converted and   that driveby shootings rarely involved more than three to five rounds    o california recently passed an assault weapon ban the   firearms banned included several nonexistent firearms   as well as a single shot shotgun most of the firearms   banned were not capable of fullauto fire and thus were   not assault weapons approximately 300000 of these   firearms are in legal hands in california the state then   required all current owners of these weapons to register   them by dec 31 1990 but only printed a fraction of the   registration forms required and so most gun owners were   not able get the required forms as a result only 30000   firearms were registered on time and another 20000 or   so late in registration these late registrations were   then turned over to state justice department for legal   action against those people who tried to obey the law    o leading studies from the us justice department   indicate that criminals fear meeting an armed victim more   than they fear running from the police in fact more   than a third of the felons surveyed admitted to having   been scared off shot at wounded or captured by an   armed victim morever almost 40 of the felons surveyed   admitted there was at least one time when they decided   not to commit a crime for fear that the victim was armed    from the reuters news service may 1 1991  headline police officials say citizens should take up arms    us police chiefs see the breakdown of the justice system as the main cause of crime and believe citizens should learn how to handle a weapon according to a survey released wednesday    a poll taken for the national association of chiefs of police surveyed heads of more than 15400 us law enforcement agencies and found that 87 percent think citizens should take training in selfdefense with firearms to protect their homes and property    the poll showed that 836 percent believe the criminal justice system has broken down to the point that its inability to prosecute and imprison criminals is the major cause of crime and 951 percent said that courts are too soft on criminals in general    nearly 90 percent believed their own departments are understaffed and three out of four said that they cannot provide the same level of service as a decade ago the survey said

were talking about gun control he remarked that it didnt matter to him if restrictions were placed on gun ownership because he didnt own a gun  what he failed to realize was the he benefits from civilian gun ownership whether he owns guns or not  he benefits because the ownership of guns by civilians has positive externalities      externatilities are unpaidfor effects that accrue to third parties from the use of property by its owners  the effect may be beneficial or harmful to the third parties  if beneficial the effects are known as positive externalities if harmful they are called negative externalities  for example someone who walks down a residential street full of welllandscaped yards might emjoy the sight and smell of flowers in bloom  though the individual homeowners paid for and cared for their particular yards the walker also benefits  the pleasure the walker receives is a positive externality of the homeowners yard care      advocates of gun control are quick to point out that innocent third parties are sometimes injured or killed by accidental discharge or criminal misuse of firearms  indeed these are negative externalities of guns in civilian hands what advocates of gun control rarely acknowlege or even understand are the positive externalities of civilian gun ownership  positive externalities may be less newsworthy but they are just as real and far outweigh the negative externalities of the right to bear arms      while accidents and criminal use of guns are reported as news making the negative externalities of gun ownership readily apparent the millions of peaceful interactions among people that occur each day are not reported  these peaceful events are taken for granted and little thought is given as to what conditions brought them about in the first place  millions awake each morning and find that their homes havent been burglarized  the vast majority of stores pass through day and night without being robbed  many women walk alone or live alone without being accosted or raped  these peaceful happenings are due to many factors such as burglar alarms door locks and police patrols but many are due in part to civilian gun ownership      one million times each year homeowners and storekeepers protect their property and lives using firearms often this occurs without a shot being fired1  the mere sight of a gun often is enough to send a robber running impressive as this number is it doesnt show the full extent to which the crime rate is lowered due to privately owned guns  in those cases where a gun owner thwarts a lawbreaker it is obvious that having a gun benefited its owner  but those cases benefit nonowners as well  if the lawbreaker is killed he will commit no crimes  if the lawbreaker is wounded captured or even escapes his inclination to commit a similar crime in the future is probably lessened  the peace that arises from the disinclination or inability to commit another crime is a positive externality of gun ownership              crime kept in check      it cannot be known how many times each day potential burglars think im not going to break into that house i might get shot  even though it is difficult to evaluate how much crime is kept in check by civilian gun ownership there is evidence that suggests its damping effect is substantial  in orlando in 196667 the numbers of burglaries and rapes fell substantially after 2500 women went through a wellpublicized training program on the use of handguns2  in a survey taken of felons 43 percent stated that the fact that a victim might be armed had caused themn to avoid particular homes or people3  there probably is no way to determine how many lawabiding citizens might turn to crime if it were a less dangerous occupation      a friend of mine a gentle and honest man once confided in me that he had stolen a car when he was a teenager  he and three friends had been walking down the street in the small town where he lived noticed a car with keys in the ignition hopped in and drove away  their joyride ended when they were pulled over by the local constable  my friend said his act of thievery hurt his mother more than anything else he ever did and he regretted it often  he was guilty of theft and knew it but he said he wished that the cars owner hadnt left the keys  even though a wellequipped criminal can break into a locked car in less than a minute leaving cars unlocked with keys in the ignition greatly increases the number of thefts      the lesson here is that if it is very convenient to commit a crime more people will commit it  this is not to say that everyone is dishonest its just a basic law of human nature that people will choose the easy way over the hard way when confronted with a task  in the task of living it is easier to take than to make  as frederic bastiat said the very nature of man  impels him to satisfy his desires with the least possible pain4  copyright laws are violated daily by otherwise honest people with access to photocopiers and tape recorders  the crime is so convenient and the victim is so distant most people who commit copyright violations probably wouldnt consider themselves criminals      bastiat said when then does the plunder stop  it stops when it becomes more painful and more dangerous than labor5  gun ownership by civilians makes burglary and robbery very dangerous and often very painful  about onehalf of all homes in the united states contain firearms6  someone considering carrying out a burglary has no way of determining if the house he plans to enter has guns in it so he avoids all occupied houses benefiting those who dont own guns as well  people who dont own guns know implicitly that they benefit from private gun ownership  how many of them would put a sign in their yard that says the owners of this house will not defend it with armed force      jails are full of repeat offenders  that is evidence that punishment is not a strong enough deterrent for some people  the punishment served up by the criminal justice system usually occurs long after the crime further attenuating any deterrence value it may have  but negative reinforcement the condition provided by an armed homeowner at the time of an attempted crime is an effective deterrent  such immediate and lifethreatening action makes crime a hazardous occupation and if crime is made a dangerous way of life the number of criminals will decline and society will be a safer place for all            restraining government      another positive externality even less apparent is the restraint that has been put on government action because of civilian gun ownership  what policies might have been put in place by federal state and local governments had civilian gun ownership been heavily restricted  in the many years since the founding of our nation what rules might bureaucrats have written if they hadnt needed to worry about an armed revolt of the masses  what invasive policies might they have come up with to make enforcement of their laws easier      there are thousands of laws in the united states that restrict gun ownership in one way or another  restrictions include waiting periods bans on concealed weapons and bans on owning particular kinds of weapons such as handguns or militarystyle semiautomatics  gun control advocates support these laws because they hope to eradicate negative externalities but reducing gun ownership eliminates positive externalities as well  in fact gun control laws probably cancel more positive than negative externalities because lawabiding citizens are much more likely to obey the rules than are criminals      the negative externalities of guns need to be decreased but the best way to minimize them is to deal with them directly  accidents can be reduced by educating owners about proper care and handling of firearms  such training is being provided by nonprofit groups including the national rifle association and at forprofit shooting ranges      criminal misuse of firearms can best be decreased by cutting the overall crime rate  methods of reducing crime have been discussed by other authors and include drug legalization eliminating barriers to entry in the work force and increasing educational opportunities      since we dont pay for positive externalities we seldom think of their value  indeed it would be a formidable task to measure the total value of the positive externalities of guns in private hands  however even without that measurement the knowledge of the existence of positive externalities should help us to understand why so many people consider the right to own firearms to be a priceless freedom      1 gary kleck crime control through the private use of armed force       social

foundation  how to make their day    here are a few things we all know about handguns they are useless for selfdefense their owners are more likely to kill relatives than assailants they tempt the lawabiding to violence false false and false    don b kates jr amp patricia terrell harris        advocates of gun control generally represent the debate as one between cool rational defenders of civil order and ignorant rednecks inspired by halfacknowledged prejudices  in fact socialscience research is increasingly on the side of the rednecks  and the arguments for banning guns are mostly myths         myth 1 most murderers are ordinary lawabiding citizens who kill a relative or acquaintance in a moment of anger only because a gun is available  in fact every study of homicide shows the overwhelming majority of murderers are career criminals people with lifelong histories of violence sometimes irrational sometimes acquisitive  the typical murderer has a prior criminal history averaging at least six years with four major felony arrests he also is likely to be a substance abuser with a record of traffic andor gun accidents  indeed even people who accidentally kill with guns tend to have similar felony records and histories of substance abuse and auto accidents  in short these are aberrant people characterized by a consistent indifference to human life including their own        our present laws acknowledge this by banning gun ownership by exfelons juveniles and the mentally impaired  these restrictions fail not because they are too narrow but because they are inadequately enforced         myth 2 the public supports gun control  fifty per cent of american householders have guns and 78 per cent of all americans say in national surveys that they would use a gun for selfdefense  americans do support prudent controls on access to guns eg by exfelons but groups advocating gun control want much broader prohibitions  for example handgun control inc hci which claims to support only moderate controls considers moderate the guncontrol laws in washington dc  that city has effectively outlawed selfdefense with guns  it prohibits handgun sales and allows hunters to have rifles and shotguns only if kept unloaded and disassembled         while americans support gun registration in opinion polls abstract endorsement becomes fanatical opposition when hci and even more extreme supporters of registration avow or are forced to admit that it is only a first step toward their goal of confiscation  hcibacked proposals to ban handgun sales and confiscate all handguns were rejected even in two of the most liberal states california in 1982 and massachusetts in 1976         myth 3 gun owners are ignorant rednecks given to senseless violence studies consistently show that on the average gun owners are better educated and have more prestigious jobs than nonowners  to judge by their applications for permits to carry guns at all times the following are or were gun owners eleanor roosevelt joan rivers dianne feinstein arthur ochs sulzberger sid caesar john lindsay robert goulet leland dupont arthur godfrey michael korda henry cabot lodge sammy davis jr lyman bloomingdale donald trump john foster dulles and john laurance david winthrop and nelson rockefeller         an early academic analysis still relied upon by guncontrol advocates that labeled gun owners violence prone turns out to have been based on survey questions that addressed only willingness to come to the aid of crime victims in other words the analyst confused good citizenship with violence  later surveys show that gun owners are less likely than nonowners to approve of police brutality violence against dissenters etc         myth 4 protection against crime is the job of the police slogans like to protect and serve contribute to the false impression that the main function of the police is to protect individuals  but the us has only five hundred thousand police officers dividing that number by three shifts per day and adjusting for vacation leave desk duty etc leaves only about 75000 police on patrol at any one time to protect 250 million americans their numbers are wholly inadequate to provide individual protection to everyone         myth 5 the second amendment protects only the states right to arm a militia  this interpretation appeared only in the twentieth century significantly the two earliest commentaries on the second amendment which were before congress when it passed the bill of rights described it as guaranteeing to the people their right to keep and bear their private arms tinch coxe and their own arms sam adams emphasis added         the founders were well aware of aristotles dictum that free governments rest on free men armed while basic to tyranny is mistrust of the people hence they deprive them of arms  to james madison author of the second amendment the advantage that the americans have over every other nation is that they are armed         the founders put todays nra mossbacks to shame  one loves to possess arms thomas jefferson wrote to george washington on june 19 1796  on another occasion jefferson wrote his 15yearold nephew games played with the ball and others of that nature are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind but the gun gives boldness enterprise and independence to the mind  let your gun therefore be the companion of your walks         myth 6 guns are not useful for selfdefense  advocates of gun control have been so certain of this that they have paid for several national surveys to prove it  awkwardly every study has shown the opposite handguns are used more often in repelling crimes than in committing them  while handguns are used in about 581000 crimes yearly they are used to repel about 645000 crimes         a related argument is that handguns kill six or even 42 times as many household members as burglars  this comparison is deceptive on several grounds  first about half of shootings by one spouse or the other are defensivekillings of homicidal husbands by victimized wives  so it misleadingly characterizes many cases in which guns save innocent lives as gun murders         also by focusing on homes the statistic excludes the numerous instances in which shopkeepers kill robbers  when the number of shopkeepers and abused wives who shoot criminals is counted the figure for defensive killings increases by about 1000 per cent         hci harps on fatal accidents and murders in the home without mentioning that the former are generally perpetrated by irresponsible aberrants and the latter overwhelmingly so  disarming the more than 98 per cent of gun owners who are lawabiding and responsible will not disarm the 2 per cent of aberrants  even if it did lack of handguns would not prevent the killing of wives and children with other weapons like the knife or the far deadlier shotgun         perhaps the most disingenuous ploy is to downplay suicides which constitute the majority of household handgun deaths in the comparison  even if we agree that stopping suicide is a legitimate use of state power it is silly to argue that banning a single method would have a significant effect  the most obvious alternative the long gun is used in roughly 50 per cent of current gun suicides         myth 7 resistance with a gun will get you injured or killed according to guncontrollers armed women frequently have their guns taken away and used against them and so hci advises submission the best way to keep you alive is to put up no defensegive them what they want or run  national victim data suggest otherwise  while victims resisting with knives clubs or bare hands are about twice as likely to be injured as those who submit though far less likely to be raped or robbed victims who resist with a gun are only half as likely to be injured as those who take hcis advice we emphasize that a gun does not make resistance safe regardless of circumstances perhaps a person with the foresight to own a gun is more likely to have pondered in advance the question of when and how to resist         myth 8 other countries have reduced violence by banning guns this claim cannot be true since low european violence long preceded gun restriction         restrictive gun laws were largely pioneered not in europe but in various highviolence american states beginning in the late 1800s  the measures failed  violence rates continued to rise  and they were largely repealed after world war 1  european gun bans began at about the same time ours were being repealed  moreover they were a response not to ordinary crime which was low but to the political crime and unrest of the era even as gun control failed to curb ordinary violence in this country so the european countries that banned guns in response to political crime have nevertheless suffered far more such crime than has america  ironically the only gun control in place when english crime fell from its appalling lateeighteenthcentury high to its idyllic earlytwentieth century low was that the police could not carry guns  the inevitable conclusion is that the determinants of violence are socioeconomic and cultural factors rather than the availability of any particular deadly instrument         moreover the emphasis on changing gun laws is fundamentally diversionary  with prosecutors judges and prisons swamped by murderers rapists robbers etc the violenceprone know they risk very little real penalty for illegal possession of a gun  in the premier criminological study of guncontrol enforcement bendis and balkin conclude it is very possible that if gun laws do potentially reduce gunrelated crime the present laws are all that is needed if they are enforced  what good would stronger laws do when the courts have demonstrated that they will not enforce them                those interested in further exploring these issues should refer to the

 involved was  first degree  murder of a peace officer in st   johns county  by three  brothers named carlton90  relative   to the  murder conviction the three brothers were appealing   the weapons

prompted  this statute   we have the good fortune to   have a  completely honest statement of its original purpose   which was  at considerable  variance from  the text  itself   the florida  supreme court  in 1941  refused to  find that a   pistol in  an automobile  glove compartment  was  carrying   within the  meaning of the statute  a concurring opinion by   justice buford asserted        i know  something of  the history  of this legislation     the original  act of  1893 was  passed when there was a     great influx of negro laborers in this state drawn here     for the purpose of working in the turpentine and lumber     camps   the same  condition existed  when the  act was     amended in  1901 and the act was passed for the purpose     of disarming  the negro  laborers and to thereby reduce     the  unlawful   homicides  that   were   prevalent   in     turpentine and  sawmill camps  and to  give the  white     citizens in  sparsely settled areas a better feeling of     security  the statute was never intended to be applied     to the  white population and in practice has never been     so applied92      no more  damning statement can be imagined as to the purpose   of the  florida law   it also fits well with our hypothesis   about   the    nominally    colorblind    laws    of    the   ireconstruction period        90 carlton v state 63 fla 1 58 so 486 1912

larsons evenhanded article on paxton quigley armed force 2493 wsj cites the worlds most notorious statistic regarding guns in the home  a pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in king county washington found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner spouse a friend or child than to kill an intruder  the 43 times stat is everywhere these days it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth it was inflated by one pugilistic talkshow pundit to 93  given the shock value of the finding the conclusion of the 1986 new england journal of medicine nejm study is remarkably understated  the advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned            responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home  but what we need to know is this  what exactly are the risks and benefits  the nejm testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks  further as with motor vehicles we want to know  what control do we have over the risks and benefits  and as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents  how can we minimize the risks  like raw highway death tolls the nejm stat is not very helpful here            the nejm finding purports to inform us but it is framed to warn us off  it is widely promulgated in the media as a scare stat a misleading halftruth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify  the frightful statistic screams for itself the risks far outweigh the benefits yes  what fool would run these risks  if your car were 43 times more likely to kill you a loved one a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination should you not take the bus            uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies  surely we can do better where lives are at stake  lets take a closer look at this risky business            the 43 times stat of the nejm study is the product of dividing the number of home intrudersaggressors justifiably killed in selfdefense the divisor into the number of family members or acquaintances killed by a gun in the home the dividend  the divisor of this risk equation is 9 in the studys fiveyear sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of selfdefense  the dividend is 387 in the study there were 12 accidental deaths 42 criminal homicides and 333 suicides  387 divided by 9 yields 43  there were a total of 743 gunrelated deaths in king county between 1978 and 1983 so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted            the nejms notorious 43 times statistic is seriously misleading on six counts            1  the dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media the or acquaintances of the study who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members is equated to friends  the implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members dear friends and innocent children  deaths may all be equally tragic but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk  these crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors  this is criminological hogwash            2  the study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent criminal or substanceabuse histories  where the risk of death is very high  versus households inhabited by more civil folk for example people who avoid highrisk activities like drug dealing gang banging and wife beating  where the risk is very low indeed  in actuality negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse people who are identifiably and certifiably at high risk for misadventure  to ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths by tautology neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk            3  one misleading implication of the way the nejm stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect and this obscures  indeed disregards  the role of personal responsibility  the typical quotation of this study unlike larsons attributes fatal agency to the gun  a gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill     the center to prevent handgun violence a major promulgator of the nejm statistic uses this particular formulation  we can dispense with the silly debate about whether its people or guns that accomplish the killing  again by tautology gun deaths would not occur without the guns  the question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway without the guns  in any case people are the deathdealing agents the guns are their lethal instruments  the moral core of the personal risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice  due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents human choice mediates homicide and suicide by gun or otherwise  the choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to nejms highrisk pool  the gun does not create this risk by itself  people have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes  for example graduates of paxton quigleys personal protection course do not run the touted 43 times risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers  undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice just as they disregard and obscure the role of socioeconomic criminological and other riskrelevant factors in firearmrelated death  this is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities  fortunately nothing can consign us to the nejm risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter            4  suicide accounts for 84 of the deaths by gun in the home in the nejm study  as against the total deaths by gun in king county including those outside the home inhouse suicides are 44 of the total death toll which is closer to the roughly 50 proportion found by other studies  suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents  the implication of the nejm study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns  it is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed  it is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides  this is widely assumed or alleged but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases see  bruce l danto et al the human side of homicide columbia university press 1982 charles rich et al guns and suicide american journal of psychiatry march 1990  if suicides were removed from the dividend of the nejm studys risk equation the 43 times stat would deflate to six  the inclusion of suicides in the nejm risk equation  like the causes durability or interdiction of suicidal intent itself  is a profoundly debatable matter  quotations of the nejm study totally disregard this issue            5  citations of the nejm study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide  most measures like the nejm homicide rate are based on the immediate disposition of cases  but many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled selfdefense  in the literature on battered women immediate case dispositions are notorious for underrepresenting the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide times january 18 1993 cover story on women fighting back reported one studys finding that 40 of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out times july 17 1989 cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51 of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims but only 3 of the homicides were reported as selfdefense  in a may 14 1990 update time reported that 12 of the homicides had eventually been ruled selfdefense in times sample the originally reported rate of selfdefense was in error by a factor of four  the possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the nejm statistic            6  while both the dividend and the product of the nejm risk equation are arguably inflated the divisor is unconscionably misleading  the divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at  the utility of armed selfdefense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes  what kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled apprehended or deterred  should we not celebrate let alone count  those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses the question posed to media that cite the nejm scare stat is this  why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense notably by criminologist gary kleck point blank guns and violence in america aldine de gruyter 1992         klecks estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies  the rate is high about one million a year and the risk is good gun defenders fare better than anyone either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist  dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30000 annual gun deaths from selfdefense homicides suicides and accidents yields 33  thus we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the nejm scare stat            a gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against         assault or other crime than to kill anybody            of course klecks critics belittle the dividend of this calculation what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control  we should indeed question the basis and method of klecks high estimation of defensive firearm use as i have questioned the nejm statistic  clearly the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics  one thing troubles me still  we can hardly escape the unquestioned nejm scare stat in our media but we hardly ever find

hollowbrook pub 1992 isbn 0893417238    who are the militia    for a  contemporary definition  of militia we can look to the virginia constitution ratification convention      mr george  mason   mr chairman  a worthy member has   asked who are the militia if they be not the people of   this country and if we are not protected from the fate   of the  germans prussians ampc by our representation   i ask  who are  the militia   they consist now of the   whole people  except a  few public  officers   but  i   cannot say  who will  be the militia of the future day   if that  paper on  the table  gets no  alteration  the   militia of  the future  day  may  not  consist  of  all   classes high  and low and rich and poor but they may   be confined  to the  lower and  middle classes  of  the   people granting exclusion to the higher classes of the   people   if we  should ever  see that  day  the  most   ignominious  punishments   and  heavy   fines  may   be   expected   under the  present government all ranks of   people are  subject to militia duty  under such a full   and equal  representation as  ours  there  can  be  no   ignominious punishment inflicted14      earlier during the virginia debates mason had warned      an instance  within the  memory of  some of  this house   will show  us how  our militia may be destroyed  forty   years ago when the resolution of enslaving america was   formed  by   an  artful   man  who   was  governor  of   pennsylvania to  disarm the  people that  it was  the   best and  most effectual  way to enslave them but that   they should  not do it openly but weaken them and let   them sink gradually by totally disusing and neglecting   the militia15      francis corbin  arguing for  the constitution  held that the concerns about standing armies were overstated      the  honorable   gentleman  then   urges  an  objection   respecting the  militia who he tells us will be made   the instrument of tyranny to deprive us of our liberty   your militia says he will fight against you  who are   the militia   are  we not  militia   shall  we  fight   ourselves   no sir  the idea is absurd  we are also   terrified by  the dread  of a standing army  it cannot   be denied  that we  ought to have the means of defence   and be able to repel an attack16      the  following   exchange  at   the   virginia   ratifying convention demonstrates  that militia  was  recognized  as constituting the whole people      mr clay wished to be informed why the congress were to   have power to provide for calling forth the militia to   put the laws of the union into execution      mr madison supposed the reasons of this power to be so   obvious that  they would  occur to  most gentlemen  if   resistance should be made to the execution of the laws   he said  it ought  to be overcome  this could be done   only in  two ways  either by regular forces or by the   people   by one or the other it must unquestionably be   done   if insurrections  should  arise  or  invasions   should take  place the  people ought unquestionably to   be employed  to suppress and repel them rather than a   standing army   the best way to do these things was to   put the  militia on a good and sure footing and enable   the government  to make  use  of  their  services  when   necessary      mr george  mason   mr chairman unless there be some   restrictions on the power of calling forth the militia   to  execute   the   laws   of   the   union   suppress   insurrections and  repel invasions we may very easily   see that  it will  produce dreadful oppressions  it is   extremely unsafe  without some  alterations  it would   be to  use the  militia to  a very  bad purpose if any   disturbance happened  in new  hampshire to  call  them   from georgia   this  would harass  the people  so much   that they  would  agree  to  abolish  the  use  of  the   militia and establish a standing army17      gov  randolph   argued  before   the  virginia  ratifying convention      in order  to provide  for our  defence and exclude the   dangers of a standing army the general defence is left   to those who are the objects of defence  it is left to   the  militia  who  will  suffer  if  they  become  the   instruments of tyranny18      alexander contee  hanson a  member of  the maryland state convention also discussed the meaning of militia  in his pamphlet in  support of ratification of the constitution he argued  that   the  concerns   about  standing  armies  were excessive and  that such  standing armies were unavoidable he concludes  that the  concerns are  a  mere  pretext  for terrifying you and that      it may well be material here to remark that although a   well regulated  militia has ever been considered as the   true defense  of a  free  republic  there  are  always   honest purposes  which are  not to  be answered  by  a   militia   if they  were the  burthen of  the  militia   would be  so great  that a  free people  would by  no   means be  willing to  sustain it   if  indeed  it  be   possible in  the nature of things that congress shall   at  any   future  period   alarm  us  by  an  improper   augmentation of  troops could  we not  in that  case   depend on the militia which is ourselves19      a committee  of the maryland ratifying convention proposed ratification of  the constitution with a list of amendments one of  which is  relevant to the second amendment20  among these provisions      13 that  the militia  shall not  be subject to martial   law except in time of war invasion or rebellion21      in  explaining   why  this  amendment  was  considered  so important the official journal of the convention argued      this provision  to restrain the powers of congress over   the militia  although by  no means  so ample  as  that   provided  by   magna  charta   and  the   other  great   fundamental and  constitutional laws  of great britain   it being  contrary to magna charta to punish a freeman   by martial law in time of peace and murder to execute   him yet  it may  prove an  inestimable check for all   other provisions in favor of the rights of men would be   vain and  nugatory if the power of subjecting all men   able to  bear arms to martial law at any moment should   remain vested in congress22      the ratifying convention refused the full list of proposed amendments    in  response  the  committee  requested  the convention  to   ratify  the   constitution  with   what  it considered  the   most  important  three  amendments    the committee explained further its concern      the first  of these objections concerning the militia   they considered  as essential for to march beyond the   limits of  a neighboring  state  the  general  militia   which consists  of so many poor people that can illy be   spared from  their families  and domestic  concerns by   power of  congress who  could know  nothing of  their   circumstances   without    consent   of   their   own   legislature or executive ought to be restrained23      the militia  then was  the same  as the adult freemen of maryland      tench coxe  of pennsylvania  was a member of the annapolis convention and continental congress  his letters were among the  first  to  appear  in  favor  of  ratification  of  the constitution and were widely reprinted in newspapers of the day24  coxe admitted      the apprehensions  of the  people  have  been  excited   perhaps by  persons with  good  intentions  about  the   powers of the new government to raise an army25      after stating  that the  constitution  contained  adequate restrictions on  the funding and control of standing armies coxe argued that      the militia  who are in fact the effective part of the   people  at   large  will   render  many  troops  quite   unnecessary   they will form a powerful check upon the   regular troops  and will  generally be  sufficient  to   overawe them  for our detached situation will seldom   give occasion  to raise an army though a few scattered   companies may often be necessary26      richard henry  lee was  appointed  to  the  constitutional convention but  declined to  serve   his pamphlet  against ratification of  the constitution  were  one  of  the  most popular of  the time27  his concerns about standing armies and the  national governments  authority to  regulate state militias  provide  both  insights  into  the  importance  of private arms in restraining national power and the identity of the people as the militia  in discussing the danger that congress might  not represent  the interests  of the  common people in  the levying  of taxes  and  raising  of  standing armies lee admits      it is  true the  yeomanry of  the country  possess the   lands the  weight of  property possess  arms and are   too strong a body  of men to be openly offended  and   therefore  it   is  urged  they  will  take  care  of   themselves that men who shall govern will not dare pay   any disrespect to their opinions28      but recognizing  that slow change is frequently capable of lulling the population to sleep in a way that radical change will not      it is  easily perceived that if they have their proper   negative upon  passing laws  in  congress  or  on  the   passage of  laws relative to taxes and armies they may   in twenty  or thirty years be by means imperceptible to   them totally  deprived  of  that  boasted  weight  and   strength this  may be  done  in  a  great  measure  by   congress if  disposed  to  do  it  by  modelling  the   militia   should one  fifth or  one eighth part of the   men capable  of bearing arms be made a select militia   as has  been proposed  and those  the young and ardent   part of  the community  possessed of  but little or no   property and  all the others put upon a plan that will   render them  of no  importance the  former will answer   all the  purposes of  an army while the latter will be   defenceless29         further evidence  of the  identity of  the militia as the people and not just a small part of the population can be found in  james madisons  federalist 46  madison sought to alleviate concerns  about federal  power   to that  end he pointed out that      the  only  refuge  left  for  those  who  prophecy  the   downfall of  the state  governments is  the  visionary   supposition that  the federal government may previously   accumulate  a   military  force  for  the  projects  of   ambition30      madison asserts  the political  unlikeliness  of  such  an event but      extravagant as  the supposition  is let  it however be   made  let a regular army fully equal to the resources   of the country be formed and let it be entirely at the   devotion of the federal government still it would not   be going  too far  to say  that the  state governments   with the  people on  their side  would be able to repel   the danger   the highest number to which according to   the best computation a standing army can be carried in   any country  does not exceed one hundredth part of the   whole number  of souls or one twentyfifth part of the   number able  to bear  arms   this proportion would not   yield in the united states an army of more than twentyfive   or thirty thousand men  to these would be opposed   a militia  amounting to near half a million of citizens   with arms  in their hands officered by men chosen from   among themselves  fighting for their common liberties   and united  and  conducted  by  governments  possessing   their affections  and  confidence    it  may  well  be   doubted whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever   be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops31    this is a clear statement that the militia was not a small professional military but the entire male population of the country with arms in their hands   there is  other contemporaneous evidence that the founding fathers considered  the militia to be equivalent to if not the people at least a very large part of the people  the militia act of 1792 declared the      militia of  the united states to include almost every   free adult  male in  the united  states  these persons   were obligated  to possess  a  firearm  and  a  minimum   supply of  ammunition and  military  equipment    this   statute incidentally remained in effect into the early   years of  the present century as a legal requirement of   gun ownership  for most of the population of the united   states32      the same  congress that  debated the  bill of rights also debated hr102 the militia bill which became in the second congress the  militia act  of 1792   its  language clearly shows      that the  militia of the united states shall consist of   each and  every free  ablebodied male  citizen of the   respective states  resident therein  who are or shall   be of  the age  of eighteen years and under the age of   fortyfive years  except as  is hereinafter  excepted   who shall severally and respectively be enrolled by the   captain or  commanding officer  of the  company  within   whose bounds  such citizens  shall reside   that every   citizen so  enrolled and  notified shall  within     month thereafter  provide himself  with a good musket   or firelock  of a bore not smaller than seventeen balls   to the  pound a  sufficient bayonet  and belt a pouch   with a box therein to contain not less than twentyfour   cartridges  suited   to  the  bore  of  his  musket  or   firelock each  cartridge to  contain a proper quantity   of powder  and ball  two spare flints and a knapsack   and shall appear so armed accoutred and provided when   called out  to exercise  or into  service as  is herein   after directed33  look this up in annals of congress      debate on the militia bill on december 22 1790 involved discussion  of  whether  the  congress  should  define  what persons would  be exempted  from militia  duty or the state legislatures should  do so   as  part of  that debate rep williamson observed      when we  departed from the straight line of duty marked   out for  us by  the  first  principles  of  the  social   compact we  found ourselves  involved  in  difficulty   the burden  of the  militia duty  lies equally upon all   persons and  when we contemplate a departure from this   principle by  making exemptions it involves us in our   present embarrassment34 emphasis added      rep randolph  in arguing for a reduction of the standing army on  january 5  1800 emphasized  that standing  armies were not  only useless  and enormous expense but contrary to the spirit of the constitution      a people  who mean to continue free must be prepared to   meet danger  in person not to rely upon the fallacious   protection of mercenary armies35      current   us   law   still   recognizes   this   organic relationship between the people and the militia      311 militia composition and classes      a the  militia of  the united  states consists of all   ablebodied males  at least 17 years of age and except   as provided  in section 313 of title 32 under 45 years   of age  who are  or who  have made  a  declaration  of   intent to  become citizens of the united states and of   female  citizens   of  the   united  states   who   are   commissioned officers of the national guard      b the classes of the militia are       1  the  organized  militia  which  consists  of  the   national guard and the naval militia and      2 the  unorganized militia  which  consists  of  the   members of  the militia  who are  not  members  of  the   national guard or the naval militia36      indeed the  current national  guard was  organized  under congress power to raise and support armies and not under the  organizing   arming  and  disciplining  the  militia provision since  the militia  can be called forth only to execute the  laws of  the union  suppress insurrections and repel invasions37    more recently  the us supreme court in us v verdugourquidez 1990 explicitly  recognized  that  the  people referred to  in the second amendment has the same meaning as it does in the rest of the bill of rights      contrary to  the suggestion  of amici  curiae that  the   framers used  this phrase simply to avoid an awkward   rhetorical redundancy   the  people seems  to have   been a  term of  art employed  in select  parts of  the   constitution     the  preamble   declares   that   the   constitution is ordained and established by the people   of the  united states   the second amendment protects   the right  of the  people to  keep and bear arms and   the ninth  and tenth  amendments provide  that  certain   rights and  powers are retained by and reserved to the   people   see also  us const  amdt 1  congress   shall make no law  abridging  the right of the people   peaceably to assemble art i  2 cl 1 the house   of representatives  shall be composed of members chosen   every second year by the people of the several states   emphasis added  while this textual exegesis is by no   means  conclusive   it  suggests   that  the  people   protected by the fourth amendment and by the first and   second amendments  and to  whom rights  and powers are   reserved in the ninth and tenth amendments refers to a   class of  persons who  are part of a national community   or who  have otherwise  developed sufficient connection   with  this  country  to  be  considered  part  of  that   community38      federalists and  antifederalists debating the constitution in state

the constitution   by clayton e cramer wakefield nh  hollowbrook pub 1992 isbn 0893417238    a good introduction to background on gun control why it doesnt work numbers etc is david b kopels hold your fire in the winter 1993 issue of policy review magizine your campus library should have it  more complete information is in gary klecks 1991 book point blank    kleck a lifelong liberal democrat and former supporter of waiting periods gives a thorough statistical analysis  he became well known in right to keep and bear arms circles for his study crime control through the private use of armed force published in the socialogical journal social problems volume 35 1988 pp 121  kleck used data from various surveys and from official department of justice statistics to estimate the frequency with which crime is stopped by armed citizens  the most comprehensive survey he looked at was conducted by democratic polling firm peter hart and assoc on behalf of the progun control national association against violence    kleck used the data from among other places the hart poll to estimate that hand guns are used to stop a crime an average of 645000 times per year moreover all guns hand guns rifles shotguns combined are used to stop roughly 1 million crimes per year  id use the 645000 number though most control efforts are directed toward hand guns and people make idle claims like concealable weapons are only useful for committing crimes    initially one might compare this with the frequence of violent crime in which a gun was used  from the u s bureau of justice statistics national crime survey 1987 you will find that there were a total of 541271 violent crimes committed with a hand gun in 1985 and 657119 violent crimes committed with any gun during 1985  thus either way we see more civilian defenses with hand guns and guns in general than crimes committed with a hand gun or with any gun    this comparison of course has its limits  for one thing we dont know how gun control would affect the frequency of defenses and crimes  for some insight consider the 1986 national institute of justice study by james wright and peter rossi  before doing this and a related nij study sociologist wright was on record as favoring stricter controls rossis credentials are certainly legitimate  he has served as president of the american sociological association  wright and rossi interviewed convicted felons in 10 state correctional systems in 1981 and found that the presence and scope of gun control laws had no effect on criminals ability to obtain firearms  of course convicted felons cannot after release legally obtain a gun they lose this right along with the right to vote and various others and can only have these restored if they sue and a judge finds in their favor  so stricter controls could not be placed on convicts seeing as theyre not allowed to possess a firearm anyway  wright and rossi found that criminals convicted of a gunrelated crime did not expect to have any difficulty obtaining a firearm the day after release from prison  moreover 83 of convicted gun predators said that if they somehow could be stopped from stealing a gun buying through a legal surrogate getting one on the black market borrowing a gun etc they would switch to long guns or sawedoff long guns  as these are more lethal than hand guns long guns being used in more crimes would likely increase the rates of fatalities    klecks 1991 book cited above does a probit regression analysis ie a regression where what the researcher wants to predict is the probability an event occurs to estimate the likelihood an attack takes place during a crime that an injury occurs given an attack and that death results given injury in order to judge whether the offenders possessing a firearm makes victim death more likely  he found that overall the lack of available hand guns would drop deaths by 14 however this he points out ignores that the unavailability of firearms would reduce the number of crimes foiled by armed citizens  moreover if the handguns were replaced by long guns klecks estimates imply that the number of deaths due to violent crime would increase by 181    what affect would the gun control have on crimes foiled by armed citizens an experiment was tried in orlando florida from oct 1966 to mar 1967 in which the orlando police department trained over 2500 women to use hand guns details of the study are in alan krug the relationship between firearms ownership and crime rates congressional record 1968 pp h5702 a followup study was published by kleck and bourda 1983 in law and politics quarterly vol 5 pp 27198  the highlights  an uninterrupted time series of orlando crime trends shows that the rape rate dropped 88 in 1967 from the 1966 level a far greater decrease than for any previous year the rape rate was constant in the rest of florida and in the u s  the only other crime to drop substantially was burglary  thus the targeted crime and the one most likely to occur where victims have access to guns dropped    pro gun control forces frequently cite one of several new england journal of medicine studies claiming that the chances of being killed with a firearm are anywhere from 5 to 43 times higher than those of killing a burglar among gun owners  the 43 number includes gun suicides no reputable study has shown that decreasing gun availability has any affect on the suicide rate  it does affect the gun suicide rate but other suicide rates increase  moreover in below 12 of all civilian defenses is the offender actually killed hence even if the 143 number were the accurate ratio it would have to be multiplied by roughly 200 to compensate for the fact that it only considers burglars killed not crimes stopped  this alone would suggest that owning a firearm is quite useful for personal defense but theres more  none of the new england journal of medicine studies restricted attention to injuries due to ones own firearm  thus if criminals are harder to disarm than the law abiding a reasonable assumption if one believes that criminals dont obey laws it is incorrect to compare my rate of killing a burglar with my firearm with my rate of being killed by a burglar with his  the point of the studies was to assess whether a gun is useful for home defense so it should compare the likelihood of my being injured with my firearm versus that of my stopping an injury to me using my firearm  also the new england jornal of medicine studies did not include any firearm defenses against any crime other than robbery by contrast they all counted against firearms any homicides committed in any setting    oh yes  one more thing  fbi data suggest that the ratio of selfdefense homicides to criminal homicides in detroit and dade miami fl conties is roughly 14  if one takes this to be a national average on an argument that the cities are geographically distinct but had similar numbers one gets an estimate of roughly 2800 civilian legal defensive homicides per year with a gun and 300 with some other weapon based on 1980 us national crime and health statistics versus 368 reported police legalintervention gun homicides and 14 police legalintervention nongun homicides  by the way one of the new england journal of medicine studies kellerman and reay 1986 gives a ratio of 22 for seattle for 197883 suggesting an even higher number of criminals killed in selfdefense by armed citizens compared with the number killed by police    what about other crimes  the us bureau of justice statistics national crime survey for 197985 gives the following numbers of completion of robberies when the victim used various methods of selfprotection     method      completed      attacked      injured                 gun             309            252           174 knife           352            556           403 other weapon    289            415           220 physical force  501            756           508 called 911      639            735           489 reasoned w  offender       537            481           307 evasion         508            547           349 compliance      885            415           247     so defending oneself against a robber with a gun reduced the chance of injury by 26 over using a nongun weapon other than a knife the next best option compared with compliance ones chance of avoiding injury by defending with a gun was 42 better  the margin of error for these numbers is extremely low the case with the fewest realizations was defense with a knife and even for that there were 59813 cases covered  thus these numbers are significant with as high a level of confidence as one likes    the national crime survey gives similar numbers for assaults though those are even more dramatic  one who defended oneself against an assault with a gun had a 232 chance of being attacked and a 121 chance of being injured  the next best choice for avoiding injury was reasoning with the offendor which led to a 400 chance of attack and a 247 chance of injury  using another weapon nongun nonknife led to a 414 attack rate and a 251 injury rate knives led to a 464 attack rate and 295 injury rate  compliance led to a 399 attack rate the lowest except for defense with a gun and a 273 injury rate    one other topic is likely to come up and you should be careful in how you reply  not long ago within the past 5 years there was a study i believe the new england journal of medicine or journal of the american medical assoc which compared the homicide rates in seattle with those in vancouver and claimed that the lower rates in vancouver were evidence for success of canadian gun control  two problems  1  the study did not adjust for demographics  seattle has a large disaffected hispanic community whose homicide rate is considerably higher than that for the rest of seattle when adjustment is made for this and for the demographic composition of vancouver the homicide rates become very close i think seattles actually becomes lower  this is a point that though valid i would hesitate to make as it would be easy for a critic to misconstrue  that is while no one would maintain that ethnicity causes homicide one might argue that ethnic strife is often associated with higher homicide rates  nevertheless a dishonest opponent would try to depict one who raised this point as a bigot  hence i offer point 2  canadas homicide rate has increased since its radical gun control law was passed in 1978 and has climbed more rapidly than the us rate  if one compares the ratio of homicides in vancouver and seattle prior to 1978 one gets if memory serves a much more dramatic disparity than the postcontrol study that is often cited  therefore it seems unlikely that the disparity is due to the canadian gun control law    someone might try to make other international comparisons  japan and england are favorites of the procontrol forces  the comparisons are worthless  first you could always counter with information comparisons with israel and switzerland high gun ownership low crime or mexico low gun ownership high crime  second you might point out that differences in crime rates are attributable to our revolvingdoor justice  eg in london 20 of reported robberies end in conviction in new york city fewer than 5 do  moreover england has twice as many firearms homicides annually as it did before it adopted its tough antigun laws    one way to make some corrected comparisons with japan adjusting for judicial system cultural differences etc might be to compare homicide rates among japanese americans who have widespread access to guns because they live here but maintain much of their japanese culture  through 1979 the fbi tracked homicide arrests by race and included a category for japanese applying the fraction of japanese american arrests to the total number of homicides during 197678 kleck in point blank pp 189 ff estimates a homicide rate for japanese americans of 104 per 100000 persons  by contrast the homicide rate in japan for the same period was 245 per 100000 or 23 times higher    some notes about britain  though the british have a much lower gun homicide rate than we have they also have a much lower knife homicide rate and a lower rate of homicide using hands and feet  are we to infer then that the british ahve fewer knives or hands and feet than americans    by the way the leading study of english gun control was done by colin greenwood firearms control a study of armed crime and firearms control in england and wales  london routledge 1972  greenwood compiled tables on gun crime rates and gun ownership rates in all 47 english police force areas as of 1969  he found that the rate of armed crime is in no way connected with the density of firearms in the community  indeed if anything the reverse appears to be true p 219  kleck analyzes greenwoods data and finds that the legal gun owner rate had a correlation of 017 with both offenses involving firearms in general and robberies involving firearms moreover the differences cannot be attributed to higher concentration of firearms in rural areas alone  what the subcommittee on the constitution uncovered was clear  and long lost  proof that the second amendment to our constitution was intended as an individual right of the american citizen to

for violent purposes  dwight travels in newengland  the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered as the palladium of the liberties of a republic since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers and will generally even if these are successful in the first instance enable the people to resist and triumph over them    and yet though this truth would seem so clear and the importance of a well regulated militia would seem so undeniable it cannot be disguised that among the american people there is a growing indifference to any system of militia discipline and a strong disposition from a sense of its burdens to be rid of all regulations    how it is practicable to keep the people duly armed without some organization it is difficult to see there is certainly no small danger that indifference may lead to disgust and disgust to contempt and thus gradually undermine all the protection intended by this clause of our

god  jean rostand  while the legislature has power in the most comprehensive manner to regulate the carrying and use firearms that body has no power to constitute it a crime for a person alien or citizen to possess a revolver for the legitimate defense of himself and his property the provisions in the constitution granting the right to all persons to bear arms is a limitation upon the power of the legislature to enact any law to the contrary  people v zerillo 219 mich 635  the police power of the state to preserve public safety and peace and to regulate the bearing of arms cannot fairly be restricted to the mere establishment of conditions under which all sorts of weapons may be privately possessed but it may account of the character and ordinary use of weapons and interdict those whose customary employment by individuals is to violate the law the power is of course subject to the limitation that its exercise be reasonable and it cannot constitutionally result in the prohibition of the possession of those arms which by the common opinion and usage of lawabiding people are proper and legitimate to be kept upon private premises for the protection of person and property  people v brown 253 mich 537  the right of the people peacefully to assemble for lawful purposes existed long before the adoption of the constitution of the united states in fact it is and always has been one of the attributes of a free government it derives its source to use the language of chief justice marshall in gibbons v ogden 9 wheat 211 from those laws whose authority is acknowledged by civilized man throughout the world it is found wherever civilization exists it was not therefore a right granted to the people by the constitution the second and tenth counts are equally defective the right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose this is not a right granted by the constitution neither is it in any manner dependant upon that instrument for its existence the second amendment declares that it shall not infringed but this as has been seen means no more than it shall not be infringed by congress this is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government  united states v cruikshank 92 us 542 1875  the rifle of all descriptions the shot gun the musket and repeater are such arms and that under the constitution the right to keep and bear arms cannot be infringed or forbidden by the legislature    the right to keep arms necessarily involves the right to purchase them to keep them in a state of efficiency for use and to purchase and provide ammunition suitable for such arms and to keep them in repair  andrews v state 50 tenn 3 heisk 1651798 am rep 8 14 tennessee supreme court 1871  we incline to the opinion that the legislature cannot inhibit the citizen from bearing arms openly because it authorizes him to bear them for the purposes of defending himself and the state and it is only when carried openly that they can be efficiently used for defence  state v  reid 1 ala 612 619 35 am dec 47 1840  the practical and safe construction is that which must have been in the minds of those who framed our organic law the intention was to embrace the arms an acquaintance with whose use was necessary for their protection against the usurpation of illegal power  such as rifles muskets shotguns swords and pistols these are now but little used in war still they are such weapons that they or their like can still be considered as arms which the the people have aright to bear  state v

1980  to prohibit a citizen from wearing or carrying a war arm    is an unwarranted restriction upon the constitutional right to keep and bear arms if cowardly and dishonorable men sometimes shoot unarmed men with army pistols or guns the evil must be prevented by the penitentiary and gallows and not by a general deprivation of constitutional privilege  wilson v state 33 ark 557 at 560 34 am rep 52 at 54 1878  the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the right of the whole people old and young men women and boys and not militia only to keep and bear arms of every description and not such merely as are used by the militia shall not be infringed curtailed or broken in upon in the smallest degree and all this for the important end to be attained the rearing up and qualifying a wellregulated militia so vitally necessary to the security of a free state our opinion is that any law state or federal is repugnant to the constitution and void which contravenes this right  nunn v state 1 ga 1 kel 243 at 251 1846  the right to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the second amendment to the federal constitution is not carried over into the fourteenth amendment so

used yet if a knife is used you will be twice as likely to be stabbed as to be shot    a quote from page 21 when guns are present victims are less likely to be injured than if the offender is armed

inborn in our hearts a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself a law which has come to us not from theory but from practice not by instruction but by natural intuition  i refer to the law which lays it down that if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robberies or enemies any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right  when weapons reduce them to silence the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncments  for people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice too  and meanwhile they suffer injustice first  indeed even the wisdom of the law itself by a sort of tacit implication permits selfdefense because it does not actually forbid men to kill what it does instead is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill  when therefore an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive a man who has used arms in selfdefense is not regarded as having carried them with a homicidal aim    quoted on page 17 in stephen p halbrook  that every man be armed the                      evolution of a
