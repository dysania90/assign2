computer architecture   parallel computing   memory systems   performance evaluation          research summary  my research targets the memory systems of sharedmemory multiprocessors  and highperformance uniprocessors  memory system design is important  because it largely determines a computers sustained performance  my  work emphasizes quantitative analysis often requiring new evaluation  techniques of systemlevel not just hardware performance        much of my recent work is part of the wisconsin wind  tunnel projectwith profs larus and wood and many  students  the project expects most future massivelyparallel computers  will be built from workstationlike nodes and programmed in highlevel  parallel languageslike hpfthat support a shared address space in  which processes uniformly reference data  our research seeks to  develop a consensus about the middlelevel interfacebelow languages  and compilers and above system software and hardware  we have recently  proposed the  tempest interface that enables programmers  compilers and program libraries to implement and use message passing  transparent shared memory and hybrid combinations of the two  we are  developing tempest implementations on a thinking machines cm5 a  cluster of workstations cow and hypothetical hardware platforms  the wisconsin wind tunnel project is so named because we use our tools  to cull the design space of parallel supercomputers in a manner similar  to how aeronautical engineers use conventional wind tunnels to design  airplanes        other recent work with madhu talluri  targets
