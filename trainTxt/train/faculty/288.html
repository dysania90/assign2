     tim davis          tim davis   im a faculty member associate professor in the    computer and information science and engineering department  at the    university of florida     if you dont recognize the picture  i havent had the beard since 91 or so and i no longer wear contact lenses     cop 4600 operating systems fall 96 notice  project 2 deadline extended nov 19 is 10 nov 21 is 5 regular deadline now nov 26       solution to midterm exam     chapters amp sections from the two books covered by   the midterm     tariq masoods home page ta for cop4600   will contain a list of frequentlyaskedquestions about   projects and other courserelated information     previous semeester exams and final with solutions   note that diagrams are missing handdrawn  please see   the solutions on reserve in marston sci library for the   diagrams     project 1 due october 22 note the extension     project 2 assign october 31   due november 19     minix 174 user guide for cop 4600     readme file on how to obtain minix 174   changes to user guide above     ftpaccessible directory containing the minix distribution   be careful downloading the files in this directory using   netscape  they are binary files and should be downloaded   using ftp in binary mode     a copy of the minix root directory   scan through this to see the source code for minix   without having to boot minix itself   if you have a cise account then cd to   davisminix174minixroot to see the same thing   allows you to grep the source code see the      minixroot readme file for more information   most of the stuff is in the usr subdirectory   the rest is currently empty      technical reports and lists of abstracts      my own technical reports and related reports of my students   and colleagues     cis technical reports       still under construction  webaware sparse matrix collection      i maintain a large collection of   sparse test matrices each matrix has its own web page with statistical information on the matrices and a small picture of the nonzero pattern  click here for sparse matrices and patterns also available via    ftp other useful collections of sparse matrices include the    harwellboeing collection and the    sparskit2 collection of     sparse matrices our web site gives you static pictures of sparse matrices  the advantage being that you dont have to download the whole matrix a dynamic viewer assuming that you have the matrix can give more information  the  emily  package is one such example      the approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm amd      now released jan 18 1996       amd will appear as mc47 in release 12 of the harwell subroutine library related amd variants not amd itself however are available for noncommercial use in    netlib and via    anonymous ftp at this site take a look at my technical report lists for more information or click    here for a set of transparencies from a talk given at the international linear algebra year direct methods workshop september 1995 hosted by    cerfacs in toulouse france or click    here for a onepage abstract of the talk for papers related to the talk see    an approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm and    a combined unifrontalmultifrontal method for   unsymmetric sparse matrices   umfpack a package for solving sparse linear systems      version 20 is now released sept 13 1995           version 21beta is also released dec 7 1995    see t a davis and i s duff    a combined unifrontalmultifrontal method for unsymmetric   sparse matrices tr95020 submitted to acm transactions on mathematical software for more information    the unsymmetricpattern multifrontal package    umfpack version 20 solves the linear system axb using lu factorization where a is a general unsymmetric sparse matrix the method relies on dense matrix kernels    the blas also see below to factorize rectangular frontal matrices which are dense submatrices of the sparse matrix being factorized  as a result it obtains high performance on riscbased workstations and vector supercomputers the package includes a  users guide and both double and single precision versions  it requires     the blas and two subroutines from the     harwell ma28 code mc21b and mc13e available from netlib umfpack is freely available for research purposes  for commercial use umfpack version 20 will soon appear as ma38 be placed in the    harwell subroutine library umfpack is written in ansi fortran 77          a beta release of    umfpack version 21 is now available only by ftp not in netlib the primary difference with version 20 is that complex and complex16 versions are included in umfpack version 21 if you use the beta release please let me know whether or not you encounter any bugs  ill submit the final release of version 21 once the beta release is tested in a real application  my test suite of complex matrices is rather limited note that the complex versions will not appear in the next release of the harwell subroutine library for which january 1996 is the target date     this work is in collaboration with    iain duff group leader of the    numerical analysis group of the    rutherford appleton laboratory england and    the european centre for research and advanced training in   scientific computation cerfacs        umfpack version 20 is also in netlib  umfpack versions 10 and 11 are no longer available nor supported        click here for a list of related technical reports      the blas basic linear algebra subprograms     the    fortran blas in netlib is a model implementation  for best performance of umfpack you should use vendoroptimized blas  alternatively an excellent optimized blas for risc workstations is available from michel dayde iain duff antoine petitet and abderrahim qrichi aniba in my experiments on a sparc 20 model 41 this optimized blas is up to four times faster than the nonoptimized blas available in netlib you can get the most recent version via     anonymous ftp to enseeiht france however since the transatlantic link can be slow ive placed    a copy with the authors permission at this   univ of florida site note that the uf copy might not be the most recent although i will try to keep it uptodate  click    here for more information about the optimized blas      floodsfloops florida object oriented deviceprocess simulators      umfpack has been incorporated as the primary sparse factorization code in the    floods and floops packages for semiconductor device and process simulation the two packages are written by    mark law
