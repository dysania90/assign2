that was designed and extensively simulated at washington university in st louis from 1988 through 1992 encompassing host and network interface architecture operating systems and protocols    we beleive axon to be the first zerocopy host network interface and the first use of distributed virtual shared memory over a wide area network    the next generation internetworking   during 198792  my students and i worked on a research project concerned with the design of the next generation of internet architecture if you are interested in rsvp and integrated services work in ietf you should look at our earlier work  important aspects of this project include     design specification and prototype implementation of a novel  multipoint congramoriented service  that can work well with  connectionoriented and datagram high speed networks can provide variable grade service on a need basis to its applications and can provide adequate reconfigurability to deal with survivability requirements due to network failures for details on a prototype implementation check this paper out on  coipk      design and implementation of gateway architectures that can support data rates of a few hundred mbps can interface with diverse networks and can implement the congramoriented service without becoming a performance bottleneck  for details on our work on a atmfddi gateway click  here

admiration our polite recognition of anothers resemblance to ourselves    for students especially when a project deadline approaches dont tell me how hard you work tell me how much you get done    sign of arrogance my opinions may have changed but not the fact that i am right    a model is an artifice for helping you convince yourself that you understand more about a system than you do   a good scientist is a person with original ideas a good engineer is a person who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as  possible  freeman dyson disturbing the universe to help keep my role
