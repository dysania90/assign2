learning algorithms that are useful for engineering applications while also making contact with learning as studied by experimental psychologists and neuroscientists i am interested in artificial and real neural networks and over the last several years i have focused on connections between reinforcement learning algorithms and dynamic programming solutions to markov decision problems related research is being conducted in collaboration with colleagues specializing in animal motor control we are working on a model of the cerebellum and other brain regions involved in motor control
