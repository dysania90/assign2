software construction hardware organization and limitations of  computers        texts    robert m keller  principles of computing september 1996  available by subscription at the cost of reproduction  this text is being substantially revised from prior years  it will be  available as it gets completed  the first chapter will be free following  which you will be given a chance to be a subscriber at a fixed estimated  cost  subscribers get the rest of the notes looseleaf and 3hole punched        david h friedel jr and anthony potts     java programming language handbook  coriolis group books 1996 isbn 1883577772              course assumptions    students should have had a first course in computing at the college  level eg cs5  prior experience in c or c is preferred although  not essential  we will be using a number of different languages including  java   a simplified derivative of c  it is possible to have only a knowledge of pascal rather than c when you start  this is fine as long as you dont freak because of language syntax  you should know about procedures arrays and  types at a minimum if you are unfamiliar with these please take cs5 6  or 50 first      is this a programming course    in a sense it is much of the course entails programming  however we  consider exposure  to computer science ideas to be the important part  the intent of the  programming assignments is to drive home these key ideas          lectures    the word lecture below is used very loosely  i expect that the lecture  periods will include some traditionalstyle lecturing but hope it will be more like a   multilogue set of dialogues  you are expected to attend ask  questions and provide comments      i am planning to lecture 5060 about minutes of the 75 minutes we have allocated  in each session  the rest of the time will be for the purpose of answering extended questions  and going into more specifics of some of the programming techniques and  examples  if you dont have things to ask of me in this remaining time i may  ask some things of you eg a quiz    threads    there are essentially three interwoven threads in the course the book  the problems and the lectures  i try to keep them in synch with one  another but active participation in all three threads is required  volumewise the book covers more material than can be discussed in the  lecture  the lecture will cover some things not in the book  staying attune to what is going on in lecture will help you focus on  the areas in the book that are important as far as exam emphasis    the problems exercise some but not all of the  things discussed in the book and lecture      course resources    the course is planned to be interactive throughout  we are eager to  prevent programming difficulties from consuming extraordinary time so  please ask when you get stuck with such difficulties  it is  much more efficient to start early on each assignment so that  you give yourself enough time to cope with the numerous contingencies  which inevitably materialize  you can get help online by emailing to  cs60helpmuddcs which goes to the graderstutors and to me  i dont  encourage use of talk because it is too slow but i check email often  when  you email a message it will typically be answered to the entire class  with parts of your message embedded  if you do not want it to be  attributed to you please so indicate in your message        by carrying problem solutions through to computer implementation you  are showing that you understand the issues principles and  techniques  i or the tutors will explain to you how to work any problem to any  level of detail if you ask  however you must do so with a  sufficient time margin  telling us at the eleventh hour that you just  arent getting it and therefore want to drop the course is not availing  yourself of the substantial help available       you are also welcome to submit email with any  question youd like to have answered or any point you would like  addressed after lecture or leave a note in my mailbox in 240  olin  of course you are encouraged to ask such questions in class as  well          there are many tools available on muddcs itself  use the  man feature of unix to find what you need and to explore  the command         man command     gives information on a specific command   the command         man k topic     lists commands relating to a specific topic  you can also  use the info reader in gnu emacs for certain library language and editor  specifics  in emacs type         escapex info    emacs is a very powerful editor which is going to be around for a long time it  is highly encouraged that you learn to use it  helpful information examples online copies of  assignments etc will be kept in various subdirectories of the  directory         cscs60    on machine muddcs  there is a web page for rex and iscal documentation  finally the corner  store maxim applies if you cant find what you want ask for  it        grading  there will be approximately six graded assignments most entailing programming  programming assignments help drive home key working concepts and  principles  assignments vary in difficulty and will not necessarily be equally  weighted  there will also be some assignments which you will not submit but  should do anyway because they will help you with other assignments  the languages for the graded assignments will probably be one in rex two in java  one in c one in prolog  and one in assembly language iscal for a simulated machine    sufficient information about the languages will be  provided to enable you to complete the assignments you do not have to know these  languages when you enter the class      here is the nominal point breakdown we use on assignments  this may vary somewhat  depending on the emphasis of the assignment          40 for general correctness                  the program should run according to specification          taking into account any dwim dowhatimean situations          eg the professor says one thing but really meant something          different  hopefully he or someone will catch this and          say something about it before it goes too far                   we are a learning community here so dont just be silent about           things that you think are errors                         20 for choice or discovery of algorithm                  sometimes the algorithm is given  however sometimes          such clues are ignored resulting in loss of points          unnecessarily or unnecessary floundering                  some people find a better way than what was suggested          they get extra credit at graders discretion                    note better does not mean more obscure or          cleverly hackedup but rather more elegant          or substantially more efficient                20 for documentation                  comments should be included in the code which expose the method          any subtleties etc                10 for style                  the code should be readable without extraordinary effort          use spacing braces etc to improve readability          layout characters are not at a premium so use them liberally                10 for robustness                  the program should not break in unusual ways for minor input          aberrations              remember you can always ask about things before you submit your actual product  there is no reason to lose points on most of the above    you also lose no points or esteem for asking        tutoring  the tutors are expected to play a key role in the course  everyone will need to interact  with a tutor even if you dont need help           you will check in with your tutor    on a regular basis and show himher your progress  checking in will be    a part of your grade             your tutor will advise you on your approach to solving the problem    documentation and presentation             your tutor will make an evaluation of your work when you are ready    to submit it and recommend a grade to me             i will assign the grade for the assignment based on the tutors     recommendation although i am not bound to follow the recommendation    100          neither i nor the tutors are your adversaries  we want you to succeed but it  requires effort cooperation and timing on your part        your directory cs60  you should have a directory cs60 which has group access by group cs60  if not the system administrator will create one for you  access to this  directory will thus be by you the instructor and the tutors but preferrably  no one else  when properly setup the directory listing obtained by ls l for  this directory should look like       2 drwxrwx   2 yourid     cs60         512 sep  8 2032 cs60    if it does not you should execute the following command from your home directory       chmod 770 cs60    the purpose of  this directory is to be able to get help on programs without mailing the program  simply indicate the file name to the instructor or tutor  he or she can connect  to the directory and write things there  it is not necessary that you keep all  of your work accessible there just the things on which you are currently working    honor code standard please read this carefully     although discussion of problems with others is encouraged  programming in cs60 emphasizes individual learning not group  projects  we observe the following standard  you may discuss the  assignment with other students  you may not  share ie give or receive  written work of any kind inside or outside the course  elaboration  in the case of programming assignments we consider  written work to include email computer files fragments of files and printed output  in developing code for a programming assignment you can  discuss ideas with others but discussion of ideas  must not involve wholesale examination or   transcription of the actual working code of  others with the exception that you may use any code explicitly  provided by the instructor       the following types of activities have occurred in the past  they have in  most cases resulted in receiving a failing grade in the course   one or more appearances before the judicial board with the attendant  blighted record and in some cases eventual itr ineligible to register status      two or more students split up an assignment then transcribe each others contributions  sometimes changing names of variables comments formatting etc          a student browses the directories of other students and finds someones  homework file unprotected  he makes a copy of the file and edits it  as above to try to make it look like his own    you would be surprised how easy it is for a grader to spot violations  if you have any doubts about whether a form of  interaction constitutes a violation of this standard please consult  with me prior to continuing      if you get significant but legitimate help from another you should acknowledge  it on your submission  you do not lose credit for this  it is only  proper to acknowledge the other person        grading weights  here is how your overall grade is determined    50 programming assignments    25 finalexamination    15 midterm examination    10 attendance participation tutorcheckin and random quizzes    exams are open book and emphasize conceptual understanding rather  than memorization of fine details          late assignment policy    submissions are done by following the instructions below  which also establishes the time of submission  the due dates on assignments should be noted carefully  the work of an assignment should be conducted in the week or weeks  before not on the last day when there is no space for the necessary  thinking          automatic grace  there is an automatic fixed oneday grace period on all assignments    in other words if the due date  states day n then the assignment must be turned in before midnight on  day n1 to receive any credit  after midnight on day n1 work you  spend on the problem is for you own edification only which is not   to say that it isnt worth doing or required you just dont get  points for it then  it is best to plan to get the assignments in  on the stated due date      cs 60 topic outline    the lectures will roughly follow this outline  the progression is at  the rate of about two of the numbered topics below per week  i should  say that this is what i would like to do  depending on background  some of the topics expand to longer than allocated with the result  that other topics get jettisoned or fall off the end  please keep up  on the reading without it being explicitly assigned  the notes  generally expand on the lectures and discussions  but the lectures  may also expand on the notes or introduce new material  more often  than not several threads will be interwoven in the lectures over a  period of time in part to emphasize the commonality of concepts from  different vantage points  brackets below indicate where chapters in  the notes start with respect to the concepts that follow  the outline  does not mention every topic  the actual

december 1996      how to submit assignments    to submit an assignment login to muddcs and run        cs60submit filename    where filename is the file containing the assignment to be submitted    the file should be an nonencoded ascii file with at most 80 characters per line  the program will ask what assignment this is a number and then submit the  assignment properly  shortly thereafter usually a few seconds you  will recieve by email an exact copy of what was submitted  you  will notice that some headers are attached containing certain  essential information  these headers are commented out so that compilation  of the program is not affected  if what you recieve is not  acceptable eg becomes mime encoded because it is more than 80 columns or contains  control characters you are responsible for noticing this  immediately correcting the file and resubmitting it  all submissions  will be kept for archival purposes but only the latest submission before  the time deadline will be graded
