142 syllabus  fall 1996         how to use this syllabus    this syllabus contains information necessary to succeed in cs 142 specifically    information on the course and course requirements this information will not be covered extensively in class it will be your responsibility to read and understand it   a tentative schedule of lecture topics readings and examinations   a checkoff sheet for lab assignments      suggestion write your name and phone number on the front of your syllabus so that if it gets misplaced it can be returned readily the assignment checkoff sheet is the only record of your assignment completions dont lose it      course description and procedures    computer science 142 is designed for students who intend to major in computer science or in areas having a strong emphasis on computer programming while no prior knowledge of computers is required the course is a challenging one and demands selfdiscipline and hard work of each student     although computer science 142 is not a new course it has been offered for many years the content has undergone extensive revision during the past 3 years this revision is in response to a new approach to computer programming known as objectoriented programming objectoriented programming is fast becoming the accepted methodology for the design and development of todays large and complex software systems and products because there are not yet text books which emphasize objectoriented programming in a first computer science course we have written our own text a first course in object oriented programming in a sense our new approach is experimental many computer science teachers are skeptical about it we are cautiously optimistic that we are developing an approach and associated materials that will prove to be effective in providing a foundation for objectoriented program design and development throughout the computer science curriculum we are sure to discover things we will want to change as we gain experience with our new approach we are anxious to receive constructive feed back from students concerning the text the programming assignments the examples the order and selection of topics or any aspect of the class     many students enrolling in this course have done a little or a lot of programming in pascal or some other programming language however it is unlikely that many students have had experience with object oriented programming if you have had little or no experience with computers and programming you may feel yourself at a disadvantage compared to others who have had programming experience some students in this situation do well and experience little difficulty while others experience significant difficulty and frustration even some students with programming experience may struggle we will try very hard to pace the course for beginners and will not let experienced programmers divert our lectures or discussions toward advanced or obscure topics if you are having trouble understanding the lectures the reading or the programming assignments then seek help early and often tas in the lab can help you your instructor can help you and you can attend a help section help sections for cs 142 are scheduled each semester times and locations are posted in the lab plan to attend at least one help section each week a teaching assistant who knows pascal well will help with design and development of the coming assignment and answer any questions you have          lectures    the purpose of class lectures is to lend structure to the class and tie the concepts together instructors will also answer questions and elaborate on concepts however you have primary responsibility for your education other learning resources include weekly help sessions given by lab tas the textbook and the computers with the borland pascal programming environment in the lab much of your learning will take place in the computer lab      texts    in addition to this syllabus you will need to buy the text a first course in objectoriented programming by theodore a norman this text is not yet published commercially but is available as a packet in the bookstore      grading    points will be assigned for each program and exam with programming assignments accounting for 25 of the grade and examinations 75 exams including the final exam will each count 25 of the final grade final grading will then be awarded on a straight percentage basis according to the following scale             a       95100 b      800833      d      667700          a      90095        c

through 500 pm on wednesday thursday  and on friday you must attend one of these orientation sessions so that you will know how the computers work what the lab procedures are and how to complete the first lab assignment     equipment the lab currently has several dozen ibm compatible pcs linked together to a file server disk system using novell networking equipment and software     diskettes you will need at least one doublesided doubledensity 35 floppy diskette on which to save your programs buy one in the bookstore better still buy two one for a backup copy you should bring them with you to orientation but it is not critical if you dont have them yet you will however need them before you do any assignments     policies lab policies change somewhat from semester to semester you can obtain a current copy of lab policies from any lab assistant however the following rules are always in force and you will be asked to leave if you break any of them    no accessing copying or displaying of pornographic material   no food or drink is allowed   dont unplug cables or remove computer covers if you are having problems get help from a lab assistant   no games are allowed on the computers at any time   no word processing   lab assistants give first priority to students with assignments to be checked off if you have a program ready to be signed off hold up your syllabus as a signal that you are ready   no illegal copying of software      help help sections for cs 142 are scheduled each semester times and locations are posted in the lab plan to attend at least one help section each week a teaching assistant who knows pascal well will help with design and development of the coming assignment and answer any questions you have these sessions are very important they will help you to gain problem solving skills and understand how to write the assigned programs in the lab the lab assistants will only check off assignments answer brief questions about program syntax and help you in using the computers tas will not write your programs for you nor debug your program logic the whole point of the lab assignments is for you to learn how to do these tasks          commonly asked questions    below are questions that are repeatedly asked about cs 142 if you dont see the answer to your question here review the previous pages or talk to your instructor or lab assistant     is there a way to obtain extra credit     no if you have time to do extra credit work you have time to do an assignment correctly     is it okay to study with someone else     yes group study is very helpful for some however dont let someone else write your programs for you or you will be unable to pass the tests     who makes up the exams do individual teachers do that     standard exams are used for all sections of cs 142 the exams closely parallel the programming assignments and text chapter exercises     what happens to my program if it is only partially finished and the lab closes or i have to leave do i lose it     you wont lose it if you save it out to your floppy disk you can then work on it some more next time youre in the lab its a good idea to save your program periodically as you work even if youre not going to leave the lab some programming errors can cause your work station to hang up so that you must power it off and on to get it working again when this happens you lose everything you did since you last did a save the borland pascal ide provides for automatic periodic saving of the program you are editing to take advantage of this feature check the auto save editor files box of the preferences dialog under the environment option of the options menu     what if i dont have the program finished by the time it is due     you have ten late days you may use without penalty those days could all be used for one assignment or one day for each of ten assignments or other combinations after the late days are used you will lose a point for each day subsequent assignments are late     am i ever allowed to play computer games     no never absolutely not not even if youre the only person in the lab     can i play around on the machine just to see how to use it     yes by all means do so try entering and running the example programs in your text or modifying your programming assignments once youve passed them off     what if i already have a diskette     if you have a 35 inch disk fine if you are using someone elses disk make absolutely sure that he or she is finished with it and that the disk is formatted for msdos 20 or later if youre buying your own disk it should be a doublesided doubledensity 35 floppy disk in any case you still need to purchase two computer science materials cards for the lab     what if i have my own computer     the lab is currently using microsoft windows and borland pascal with objects 70 on ibm compatible pcs if you want to use your own computer you should have an ibm pc or compatible atampt compaq etc and your own copies of microsoft windows and borland pascal with objects 70 you will also need to get a copy of the cs142 and turtles units from one of the lab tas you must still bring your programs into the lab to pass off     what if i have a nonibmcompatible computer     if you have a pascal compiler on it you can use it to learn some things about pascal but it wont have windows or the cs142 and turtles units so you wont be able to write the programming assignments on it     what is the best way to schedule time in the lab all in a single block or in separate hours     most people do best if lab hours are spread out through the week some people get uptight if they sit very long at a terminal we recommend that you design and write your programs on paper before going into the lab to enter and debug them     will classes be held the week of exams     yes always and be sure not to miss your exams plan to take the exams at the times scheduled only in rare cases will makeup tests be given     what can i do if i need more help     three things    help sections a schedule is posted in the lab   see your instructor during his or her office hours individual ta assistance may be arranged   hire a tutorthe tutoring service is run by the student academics office and freelance tutors often advertise on bulletin boards and in the daily universe      can i share a disk with someone     not recommended you need your own disks     do the help sections really help     yes they are very useful in helping students understand how to complete lab assignments students who attend usually are very positive in their evaluation of the help sections one interesting observation failing students are almost never regular attendees of the help sections     how can i get the most out of this class i feel uncomfortable in large classes     there is no reason to be wary of large classes studies show that unless the class is very small less than a dozen students the size of the class has no correlation to the amount of learning that takes place much of your learning will take place in the lab anyway the best way to learn pascal or any other programming language is to write as many programs in it as you can      go to     cs 142 assignment checkoff sheet fall 1996     go to      created aug 17 1994      updated mon apr 10 152947 1995   by scott s mccosh send comments to
