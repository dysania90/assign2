prerequisite      graduate standing and an undergraduate course in operating systems  such as cs 372 students are expected to be familiar with the material  in chapters 112 of operating systems concepts by peterson and  silberschatz            synopsis      cs 380l is a breadth course in advanced operating systems covering  both theoretical and practical issues in operating system  design topics to be covered include design and implementation of  distributed and realtime operating systems system support for  mobilewireless computing environments and some case studies an  emphasis will be placed on current design issues and research topics            textbooks      a collection of research articles will be made available by the  instructor            course requirements      students will be required to read a number of papers in the area and  discuss them grades will be determined by two examinations 50 a  term project 40 and project presentation 10
