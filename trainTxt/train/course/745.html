sieg 219  phone 6851934  hours by appointment  mail levesoncswashingtonedu   course description  instructional objectives   teaching the terminology and concepts of software engineering  teaching the fundamentals of software project management and working in a team  providing experience with a real industrial software engineering project  teaching oral and written communication skills  producing a portfolio      this course will study the concepts methods and tools for the specification design construction testing analysis and documentation of large software systems  included also will be nontechnical topics essential to creating complex software systems successfully project management effective oral and written communication and group interaction  these latter topics are what most industrial feedback says are the most important to employers and are the most often lacking in our graduates       this experimental version of cse 403 lasting two quarters will use a real boeing project as an example and the participants will work in one large group  there are several reasons for trying this new approach  the first is that one quarter is too short for a realistic project so students cannot learn enough about software engineering due to class sessions being devoted to discussing and organizing the project  in the regular 403 class the group projects are also usually learning experiences about how hard it is to work in a group but not enough is learned about how to work effectively together  by having one group headed by the instructor disasters can be avoided and more experience can be provided in the correct way to work together  in addition students will get experience in requirements analysis and a real software development that is not possible in the normal class setting       at the end of the two quarters students will have a portfolio of a real software engineering project that they can use in their job search an example of such a portfolio done for the cmu software engineering institutes masters of software engineering program will be provided at the first class meeting       in the class each student will be assigned a specific role to play that will allow them to experience a leadership position see attached list of roles  however everyone will participate in each phase of the project so they can learn how to do each part  the instructor will act as the project manager          outline of topics   nature qualities and principles of software and software engineering  management of software projects process models working in groups       project planning risk assessment cost estimation metrics etc  requirements analysis  specification  software design  verification and validation testing and analysis  configuration management  reviews  maintenance evolution  reuse   ethics and professionalism in software engineering  embedded systems and safety     roles for class project   each student will take one of these leadership roles for the project   however everyone will participate in each activity or in reviews of the activity so that they get experience with each aspect of a software development team  in addition each class member will be responsible for a presentation at a boeing review meeting       project administratorassistant program manager      responsible for project planning and control
