prerequisite or corequisite c212  textbook  alfred v aho and jeffrey d ullman foundations of computer science c edition  computer science press new york 1994  course description  almost every course in computer science uses concepts from mathematics  it is the aim of this course to present many of the mathematical topics that are frequently encountered while learning computer science    those who have taken c201 using scheme know the importance of recursion in programming  we start by examining in more detail the concept of recursion in chapter 2 entitled iteration induction and recursion  in preparation for study in the analysis of algorithms we shall look at the bigoh notation in chapter 3   throughout mathematics we find that graphical representation of ideas make them easier to comprehend  the same is true in computer science and we next go to chapter 5 to discuss special graphs called trees as they are used as a data model in computing  sets are another important mathematical concept underlying much of computer science and these are treated in chapter 7  those who work in database theory know the importance of the relational databases  we next study functions and relations from a set theoretic point of view  chapter 9 presents a more general discussion of graph theory than the previous discussion of trees  logic underlies all of computer science  we next cover propositional logic which makes up chapters 12 and 14 of aho and ullman  if time permits in the last part of the course we shall investigate finite state automata a way of modeling computation  this material is is contained in chapter 10 if time permits we shall also discuss turing machines and the halting problem      note that we have skipped many of the chapters in our text  we shall also skip over many of the sections within chapters  this text is designed for a yearlong course which introduces students not only to the fundamental ideas underlying computer science but also to the important data structures used in computing  it would be nice to have enough time during the semester to cover the whole text but since this is not the case and since the material that we skip is so interesting you might consider reading some of the sections or chapters we skip to get a head start for some of the future courses       homework assignments will be posted to the class web page regularly usually due the next discussion section  late assignments will not be accepted please write your solutions to the problems in a way that will be easy for the graders to read and understand  presentation of the answers is a significant factor in grading homework       in this course you may discuss assignments with other students do not assume this is true in all your courses  we expect you to actually think through and fully understand assignment solutions  we have found that students who copy someone elses work and turn in something they do not fully understand usually do poorly on the examinations which carry much more weight in grading    teamwork in doing assignments is good as long as each member of the team contributes and fully understands the assignment if you are working with a group please indicate it on your homework papers  if someone has given you a lot of help acknowledge them you will not be penalized and they will get the thanks they deserve      announcements

exams and any exceptions  to our usual office hours   to ensure that people can get  that info even if they dont have a web browser at home but can read the newsgroup  you are also encouraged to use it to post questions related to the course or share related information with the rest of the class on individual matters please feel free to contact us in person or via email    this web page will be the primary means of outofclass information dispersal for c241 this semester    this course description is accessible as an html hypertext markup language file on the www world wide web with the url

integrity to be sure you understand the rules under which computer science courses operate  cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the office of student ethics a branch of the office of the dean of students  withdrawal   is the last day until 400pm to drop a course or withdraw from all courses with an automatic w  after that date a student may withdraw only with the permission of his or her dean this approval is normally only for urgent reasons related to extended illness or equivalent distress        is the last day for deans to approve a course drop      incomplete grade  an incomplete i final grade will be given only by prior arrangement in exceptional circumstances conforming to university and departmental policy which requires among other things that the student must have completed the bulk of the work required for the course with a passing grade and that the remaining work can be made up within 30 days after the end of the semester if these conditions cannot be met withdrawal is the appropriate course of action     special accomodation   students who need any special accommodation must contact the the professor during the first week of class to discuss arrangements  questions  if you have questions about any of these policies please ask the instructor    honors stuff    extra problemhonors hw due fri 1025    honors hw due fri 1025    announcement
