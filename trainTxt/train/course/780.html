exercise 5      the second assignment is due wednesday  april 5  read chapter 2 of the course notes and do exercises 17  next determine the most convenient way to  run khoros and cantata for you  in cse it runs on suns such as  lillith  edit your local workstations login file to contain  xhost lillith  then add to you cshrc file on the suns the following       setenv khoroshome usrlocalkhoros   setenv manpath usrlocalkhorosman   set pathkhoroshomebin path      after an rlogin onto lillith with your rhost assignments  and display environment variable set up appropriately type  cantata at the unix prompt  in ee the machine george has  khoros and cantata installed on it      also go to our course home page on the www    and follow the links to the khoroscantata tutorial  go to its  course outline to experiments and do at least the first two  topics image information and spatial resolution  the ideal way to take the tutorial is to read the web pages  and experiment with khoros in another x window  there is nothing to turn in for this part of the assignment      the third assignment is to read the article by lin huertas and  nevatia on pp6269 of the cvpr94 proceedings and also to  look at the article by wolff on pp369376      the fourth assignment is due monday  april 17  in this assignment  we make a comparison of three imageprocessing software environments  khoros msvcc amp image and matlab image processing toolbox  the objects of the assignment  are 1 to gain some experience with each environment  2 to begin to get a feel for the strengths and weaknesses of  each of these environments and 3 to explore the use of  convolution in noise suppression and edge detection    in each environment a select a monochrome test image  b apply the sobel operation to the test  image c apply a moving average filter to the test image  d apply a 3 by 3 laplacian to the test image  e simulate gaussian smoothing with larger standarddeviation  gaussians by iteratively applying the moving average filter  f apply the 3 by 3 laplacian to each gaussiansmoothed image  g describe the results obtained in terms of changes in appearance  to objects and contours in the test image  h describe the following aspects of the implementation  what menu selections direct manipulations or programming you  had to do to perform the experiments how fast the operations ran  and level of learning effort required on your part        announcements     the final examination will be on monday june 5 from 230 to 420pm  in our regular class meeting room  the exam will cover a combination  of premidterm and postmidterm material  here is a list of topics to study  reminder the class approved sunday june 4 from 130230  as the time for the finalexam review meeting  the plan is to meet in  sieg 422        outlines for selected class periods are available here  friday 28 april  monday 1 may  wednesday 3 may  monday 8 may  friday 12 may  monday 15 may  wednesday 17 may  friday 19 may  monday 22 may  wednesday 24 may  copies of the overhead transparencies for the may 22 and 24 lectures on  neural nets are available at the engineering library copy center 2nd floor  as cseee 576 packet number 2 trainable classifiers  friday 26 may      students in 576 are permitted to get a temporary copy of  matlab for their own use in the course  this will require  that you fill out a form and sign a contract  let me know if you are interested      term projects are an important part of  the course  these are to be started during the week of april 24      here are some corrections to the course notes        on friday april 7 we were introduced to the pentium laboratory including  the msvcc software development environment    here is  evan mclains document  explaining how to add a new transform to the image application      here is   current status of the khoros installation on the suns  it contains the most recent information about getting started with  khoros and the accompanying dip course  please read this        no class on friday march 31 or monday april 3       most students already have a computer account that can access  khoros and cantata  if you do not contact renee reed on  thursday or friday to make an arrangement to pick up your  account login name and password so that you can use it  over the weekend and early next week  renees hours are  limited so plan ahead  her email address is reedcs and  she is in part of sieg 127 in a back office  sieg 127 is kept locked so you will either need to knock or  have a prior arrangement to meet her    many of the account application cards were not signed  we will  have to take care of that next week       selected lecture slides      monday march 27   wednesday march 29      information resources
