available on the class web page    you will need the textbook  modern operating systems  by tanenbaum    for the programming  assignments you should purchase a copy of  objectoriented programming using c  by pohl or whatever is your favorite c book        the lecture notes are available now  you should read the first section before coming to class  modern operating systems  and  objectoriented programming using c  are available in the book store    lectures and discussion sections  lecture times  tuesdaythursday 13001415     1221 computer sciences      discussion section  wednesday 13001350     168 noland      note that there is the extra wednesday at 1300 discussion section  this section will be used mainly as a recitation section to discuss material  covered in lecture and for the weekly quizzes  on occasion it will be used to discuss important details of  the programming assignments and homeworks  make sure that you leave room in your schedule to attend this section  examsquizzes  there will be no midterms  the final is optional      each week starting the second week of classes there will be a quiz in the  discussion section  the quizzes will last 1530 minutes  following are the past quizzes with answers      processes and concurrency  february 7    semaphores  february 14    monitors  february 21    messages  february 28    scheduling amp synchronization

about four programming assignments during the semester  details on these assignments will be given in class handouts  these assignments will be written in c and done on workstations running  unix  it is unlikely that you will be able to do all these assignments on your personal  computer      programming assignment 1  is available  the goal of this assignment is to practice using c learn some unix system  facilities and try to write a really inputtolerant program    programming assignment 2  is available  the goal of this assignment is to write a program that uses multiple processes  and synchronization    programming assignment 3  is available  you are to write a simulator for cpu scheduling algorithms you will use  traces of activities on a real unix systems to drive your simulation  the goals of this assignment are to  1 learn more about the cpu scheduling algorithms  2 learn about tracedriven simulation  and  3 experiment with quantitatively analyzing a computer system      written problem sets  during the semester i will hand out several  written problem sets based on the lectures  these problem sets are for your use and do not need to be turned in  though you will find that you will do poorly on the weekely quizzes if you  dont do the problems  solution sets for the problem will be handed out about two weeks after the  problem set  the ta and i will be happy to answer questions on these problems and  look over your solutions      problem set 1  is available  the goal of this assignment is to learn about using the various synchronization  primitives to solve problems    problem set 2  is available  the goal of this assignment is to learn memory management hardware and software      late work  assignments are due at 5 pm on the date listed on the handout  over the entire semester  you have  three late days  of credit  you can use these late days on different assignments eg one day on each  of three assignments or all three days on one assignment  other than these three days  absolutely no late work will be accepted      late days cannot be used on any assignment  that is due during the last week  of classes    cheating  programming assignments will be done with partners  each group of two will work independently from other groups      cheaters will receive the maximum penalties which include receiving  an f grade for the course and having this marked on your transcript    computer facilities  we will probably be using the solaris unix workstations for this course  these are unix workstations running the sun solaris operating systems and x windows  all students who have registered for this class should have an account    grading policy    if you dont take the final                   if you take the final   programming assignments40

the week after spring break  if you take the final exam it will be counted as above  in the past when ive taught this class the class gpa has been in  the range of 2931    class schedule  the
