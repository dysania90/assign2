of c251 and participants must be enrolled as honors division  students  it is assumed that you have taken c211 here at indiana and so are familiar with the scheme programming language the particular skills needed are the ability to program in a symbolic programming language and the experience of programming with recursion  textbook  we will use the textbook logic and discrete mathematics by winfried karl grassmann and jeanpaul tremblay prenticehall 1996 at this time the text book is on order it has not arrived at the book stores yet  course description  the mathematical foundations of computer science differ somewhat from from those of the physical and social sciences  the study of computation has two main branches performance and meaning  in formalizing performance we focus on combinatorics and statistics whose foundations are included in traditional mathemematics  in formalizing meaning we draw more heavily on logic both as a way to express ideas about programs and as a discipline for describing what computers are and what they do     computation takes place in a discrete  digital  domain where all phenomena ultimately reduce to binary 1s and 0s to explore this universe we need different mathematical tools than are used by physicists and chemists  we use  induction  far more often than differentiation or integration for example and will see numerous styles of inductive reasoning in this course  we will also explore discrete mathematical structures trees and other graphs that are prevalent in computing     the main goal of the course is to improve each participants ability to conduct a rigorous mathematical argument that is to do proofs one reason not the only one we look at logic in this course is for the purpose of evaluating proof narratives  a central idea of this course is that doing a proof and programming are pretty much the same activities the better you are at proving the better programmer you will be more important the better computer scientist you will become     i plan to follow the text book except for chapters 4 prolog 8 specification in z and 12 relational database systems  i may have to skip more chapters depending on our progress through the material i may also introduce some topics from later chapters as we go along there are a few topics not in the text that we may look at again if there is time  in any event i will cover all the material of a core 251 course  syllabus and supplementary material   one or two weeks will be devoted to each of the chapters listed below supplementary material is or will be included below the chapter listing in some cases this is an evolving syallabus which will grow as the course develops  check it weekly for new additions to the supplementary material    chapter 1 propositional

topics time permitting   homework assignments  in studying the textbook material you should work enough exercises and problems in the text to ensure that you understand the material since many of the discussions in class will derive from these exercises we should be certain that at least one individual has worked through every one of them so every problem has assigned to it one or two students who are expected to be able to present the problem at a class meeting these assignments are maintained in the s251 newsgroup  most homeworks will not be graded for credit the purpose of these assignments is to guide participants in preparing for the presentation of material in the class and to show the kinds of problems that will be asked on examinations  challenges  are homework assignments that are offered for credit  these will be clearly indicated when posted     homework assignment one  homework assignment two      due monday february 5 in class  homework assignment three      due thursday february 29 in class  homework assignment four        solutions  are posted  homework assignment five      given in class on april 2      due thursday april 4 in class  homework assignment six      due thursday april 18 in class      solutions  are posted      in this course you are welcome to discuss assignments presentations and challenges with other students do not assume this is true in all your courses teamwork in doing assignments is good as long as each member of the team contributes and fully understands the assignment if you are working with a group please indicate it on your homework papers  if someone has given you a lot of help acknowledge them you will not be penalized and they will get the thanks they deserve     grading and gradebooks  the gradebook will be posted on this home page and updated regularly   thu mar 28 111624 est 1996  wed apr  3 163446 est 1996  fri may  3 130236 est 1996   the listing of evaluation criteria shown below is tentative  for this honors class i would like to place greater emphasis on interation and participation than on formal examinations and assignments  however the form of participation is something i would like to discuss at the first meeting of the class  also since i am required to enter a grade for each participant at the end of the semester some objective performance comparison will be necessary    35 for paricipation including classroom presentations     class discussion posted challenges and projects  20 for exam 1     to be scheduled during the discussion session w 715915    week and location to be announced  20 for exam 2     to be scheduled during the discussion session w 715915    week and location to be announced  25 for the final exam     currently scheduled for tuesday april 30 1230230pm    location to be announced     communication  this  home page  is the primary distribution point for information as the course progresses please check it regularly     the course newsgroup accscic251 used to post announcements such as assignments exams and any exceptions to our usual office hours  you are also encouraged to use it to post questions related to the course participate in discussions or share related information with the class  please make a habit of looking for new notes a few times each week     on individual matters please feel free to contact your instructor or associate instructor via email or to drop by their office  the scheduled office hours are reserved for s251 students but you are welcome and encouraged to drop by at other times  course evaluation  participants are strongly encouraged to use the departments worldwideweb based course evaluation system which can be accessed through the computer science departments  home page evaluation summaries will be extracted two times during the semester during the first three weeks students will be asked to provide feedback on all aspects of the course providing an early opportunity to inform the instructors about how the course should be run     final course evaluations are taken seriously by the department and are integral to yearly faculty and department evaluations to encourage participation credit  will be given to those students who submit a full evaluation during the week prior to final examinations  the evaluations are anonymous but a transaction record is generated whenever an individual evaluation is updated these transaction records are compiled and sorted by the undergraduate secretary  thus the instructor is informed about who filed evaluations independently of what those evaluations may contain final evaluation content will not be reviewed by the instructor until after grades are assigned  policies   attendence not all the material presented in this course is in the text book class attendance is not monitored and is not mandatory although regular attendance and class participation are a factor in grading   attendance at examinations is mandatory and makeup examinations will normally not be given no special assignments or projects will be given to help students raise their grades        academic integrity if you have not already done so please read the computer science departments statement on academic integrity to be sure you understand the rules under which computer science courses operate  cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the office of student ethics a branch of the office of the dean of students     withdrawal wednesday march 6 is the last day to drop a course or withdraw from all courses with an automatic w  after that date a student may withdraw only with the permission of his or her dean this approval is normally only for urgent reasons related to extended illness or equivalent distress          incompletes an incomplete i final grade will be given only in exceptional circumstances conforming to university and departmental policies which requires among other things that the student must have completed the bulk of the work required for the course with a passing grade and that the remaining work can be made up within 30 days after the end of the semester if these conditions cannot be met withdrawal is the appropriate course of action
