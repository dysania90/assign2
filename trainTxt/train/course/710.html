faulttolerance lorenzo alvisi    distributed systems have moved beyond the confines of academia and research labs and are revolutionizing the way in which businesses governmental organizations and simple citizens are processing and collecting information current technological trends promise to dramatically increase the pace of this revolution by enabling the design of highly cooperative distributed applications that go beyond the clientserver paradigm to harness the computational power of distributed systems    in this new environment the scope and emphasis of faulttolerant techniques are about to undergo dramatic changes faulttolerance will cease to be an expensive feature required by a handful of applications to tolerate exotic failures  to the users of a highly distributed information infrastructure faulttolerance will translate to a competitive advantage guaranteeing reliable access to critical information    in this talk we will explore a new way to design and engineer faulttolerant solutions which we call lightweight faulttolerance the goals of lightweight faulttolerance are  to require few dedicated resources and have a negligible impact on performance during failurefree executions to scale its cost depending on the severity and number of failures that need to be tolerated to integrate with applications in a way transparent to the application programmer to enable and support emerging applications that will communicate through messages as well as files to address softwaregenerated faults effectively        cilk and cilknow adaptive and reliable parallel computing on networks of workstations robert blumofe    this presentation overviews cilk pronounced silk an algorithmic parallel multithreaded language and cilknow a runtime system that supports a functional subset of cilk on networks of workstations  cilknow provides adaptive parallelism and fault tolerance tranparently to user programs  adaptive parallelism means that the set of workstations on which a cilk program runs can grow and shrink dynamically depending on the availability of idle workstations and on the amount of parallelism within the program  in addition a cilk program can continue execution even if one or more of its workstations crashes because the cilknow runtime system automatically detects and recovers from such failures  the presentation includes a live demonstration     distributed io from clusters to internets mike dahlin    this presentation gives an overview of current issues in distributed file system io technology trends and new applications motivate more aggressive cluster and wide area network io systems in clusters fast networks allow machines to cooperate closely to service io requests the xfs file system uses close cooperation among nodes to provide better performance and availability than a single central server in wide area networks the challenge is to provide good performance availability and consistency despite limited network performance and node or network failures the wfs file system project will explore these issues     the spatial semantic hierarchy for human and robot cognitive maps  benjamin kuipers    human cognitive maps rely on several different representations for largescale space each with its own ontology  similarly a variety of different approaches have been proposed for robot exploration and mapping of unknown environments  we cast these diverse representations into a natural structure that we call the spatial semantic hierarchy ssh in which the objects relations and assumptions at each level are abstracted from the levels below    each level of the ssh has its own mathematical foundation  the control level allows the robot and its environment to be formalized as a continuous dynamical system whose stable equilibrium points can be abstracted to a discrete set of distinctive states trajectories linking these states can be abstracted to actions giving a discrete causal graph representation of the state space  the causal graph of states and actions can in turn be abstracted to a topological network of places and paths  local metrical models such as occupancy grids of neighborhoods of places and paths can then be built on the framework of the topological network without their usual problems of global consistency     mathematical principles of logic programming vladimir lifschitz    logic programming as well as its sister approach functional programming is based on the view that a computer program does not need to contain any explicit operational instructions  instead it can simply provide a set of facts about the problem that is sufficient to solve it  such a declarative program can be executed using methods of automated reasoning  prolog is the best known logic programming language    the mathematical theory of logic programming is concerned with defining the semantics of logic programming languages describing the reasoning algorithms used to implement them and investigating the soundness of these algorithms     adaptive libraries and high level optimization calvin lin    this talk describes a new approach to building software libraries by making libraries that can adaptin both their implementation and their interfacesto different application needs and different hardware platforms we can produce libraries that are more efficient and more widely usable  we describe a new framework for building such libraries we describe three planned experiments that apply these techniques to libraries for parallel scientific computation and we explain how our approach facilitates high level optimizations     learning sequential decision tasks through symbiotic evolution of neural networks risto miikkulainen    a novel reinforcement learning method called sane symbiotic adaptive neuroevolution evolves a population of neurons through genetic algorithms to form a neural network for a given task symbiotic evolution promotes both cooperation and specialization in the population which results in a fast efficient genetic search and discourages convergence to suboptimal solutions  sane is able to extract domainspecific information even under sparse reinforcement which makes it an effective approach to a broad range of sequential decision tasks such as robot control game playing and resource management     alamo the net as a data warehouse dan miranker    the alamo effort is directed at intranet development and internet users who can enumerate interesting sites and data sources the goal is to integrate the data sources and provide the user with the illusion of a single virtual database followed by query analysis and presentation tools    central to the alamo architecture is a software bus called the abstract search machine asm the asm is a corba compliant interface that provides a uniform interface to heterogeneous data sources beyond simple data access the asm embodies a higher level of abstraction enabling the efficient coding of clever search algorithms and separating and isolating system concerns including buffering and data prefetch    the broad claim is that high performance often optimal implementations of advanced database facilities such as an objectoriented query engine a deductive inference engine an active database engine and data mining facilities can all be constructed using the asm as a common interface    finally since the output of each of these advanced database facilities can themselves serve as data sources the components of the alamo architecture can be composed to resolve higher level data integration problems in particular we anticipate using the elements of alamo itself to represent metadata and resolve both structural and semantic conflicts among the data sources ultimately further compositions will embody complex knowledgebases and be able to answer highlevel queries     learning to process natural language using inductive logic programming raymond j mooney    inductive logic programming ilp addresses the problem of learning prolog programs from examples  the representational power of firstorder logic offers advantages over standard machine learning methods constrained to use fixedlength feature vectors  we are applying ilp methods to naturallanguage learning where we believe this richer representation offers important advantages  we have developed an ilp system chill for learning deterministic parsers from a corpus of parsed sentences chill obtains superior results on several artificial corpora previously used to test neuralnetwork methods and encouraging results on the more realistic atis corpus of airline queries  chill has also been used to the automatically develop a complete naturallanguage interface that translates english database queries into executable prolog form producing a more accurate parser than a handbuilt system for querying a small geographic database  we have also developed an ilp system foidl which has been applied to learning the past tense of english surpassing the previous results of neuralnetwork and decisiontree methods on this problem     software reuse by specialization of generic procedures through views gordon s novak jr    software reuse is clearly a good idea but it is difficult to achieve in practice if your data does not fit the assumptions of the software reusing the software will be difficult  in our approach views describe how application data types implement the abstract types used in generic procedures  a compilation process can specialize a generic procedure to produce a version that is customized for the application data  graphical user interfaces make it easy to specify views  an automatic programming server has been implemented on the world wide web it will write specialized programs for the user in a desired language and serve the source code to the user as a file     analysis of algorithms  greg plaxton    a major focus of theoretical computer science is the design and analysis of asymptotically efficient algorithms sequentialparalleldistributed deterministicrandomized for specific computational problems  in this research area it is not uncommon to come across wellwritten papers in which informally i the main underlying ideas are conceptually straightforward ii the formal presentation is surprisingly lengthy and iii most of the formalism deals with minor sideissues and special cases that have little or nothing to do with the main underlying ideas  in such papers there seems to be a significant gap between the conceptual and formal difficulty of the algorithm being presented  are such gaps inherent or is conventional mathematical notation simply inadequate for succinctly formalizing certain conceptually straightforward algorithmic ideas    in this talk i will describe a notation for asymptotic analysis called oinotation that significantly reduces the conceptualtoformal gap associated with a nontrivial class of algorithms  as a concrete example i consider the analysis of the wellknown lineartime selection algorithm due to blum floyd pratt rivest and tarjan     the design and evaluation of parallel algorithms vijaya ramachandran    the design and analysis of efficient parallel algorithms for combinatorial problems has been an area of extensive study in recent years and a large number of algorithms have been developed on the abstract pram model of parallel computation  in this talk we will describe some of our work in the design of efficient parallel algorithms and our experience with implementing and evaluating these algorithms on a massively parallel machine maspar mp1 we will then describe a queuing variant of the pram model which we propose as a more appropriate model for currently available parallel sharedmemory machines than traditional pram models     extensible languages open compilers and reflection paul wilson    extensible languages allow interesting new features to be added to a language portably from within the language itself    open compilers allow fairly easy modification of compilers to add new features analyses and optimizations    reflection allows a program to examine a representation of interesting parts of itself and affect its own structure accordingly    ill discuss these things why theyre useful for building modular portable and adapatable software  ill also discuss our recent work on the rscheme compiler an open compiler for an extensible language      last modified november 15 1996  robert blumofe
