computing    a introduction     could a computer be conscious what would a continuous programming language be like  what kind of materiality exists on the web  how will computation affect the future of science  what about quantum and dna computers  is it ethical to give computers power over human life      addressing such questions requires knowing what computers are and what computation is  to a depth it is argued in this course beyond that reached by current theories  come and find out why what we know what we dont know what a more adequate theory would look like       a critical examination of the conceptual foundations of computing focusing on       the models and metaphors in terms of which we understand         computing  from programs to processes architecture to         abstraction parameterization to parallelism and     the use of computational concepts in adjacent fields  from         cognitive science to physics economics to art      initially we focus on six traditional views formal symbol manipulation recursive function theory effective computability amp computational complexity digital state machines information processing and newell and simons notion of a physical symbol system  nonstandard views are also considered such as connectionism nonlinear dynamics and artificial life  throughout each view is judged by its ability to do justice to practice  we conclude by briefly considering the wider role of computational concepts in intellectual life  including their affect on our selfconception      b administrative details     class conceptual models of

typically from one or more        philosophy courses if in doubt please contact the instructor    grading no midterm or final exam three or four        problem sets will be distributed each consisting        of a series of structured essay questions a term paper may be        substituted for final problem set at the students        discretion the notion of a right or        wrong answer is considered inappropriate grades        wil be based on the clarity imagination and depth of        answer experience suggests that it will take the typical        student 20 hours to complete each problem set to a gradea        level    format it is tentatively planned that problem        set responses will be submitted online        where they will be graded crossreferenced and made available        to other class members  an online discussion of each question        will be conducted after problem sets solutions have been        submitted    sections no formal sections students are
