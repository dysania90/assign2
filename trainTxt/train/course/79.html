1995      parent directory       eecs 141 digital integrated circuits  fall 1995    this course aims to convey to the senior eecs students techniques to analyze and design digital integrated circuits upon completion of the course the student will be able to design simple digital integrated circuits for a number of technologies mos and bipolar and will be familiar with the use of modern computer aided design tools as such heshe will be able to work in a team of designers      1 contents    the course will start with a detailed description and analysis of the core digital design block being the inverter implementations in cmos ecl and bicmos design approaches will be discussed next the design of more complex combinational gates such as nand nor and exors will be discussed looking at optimizing the speed area or power the learned techniques will be applied on more evolved designs such as adders and multipliers the influence of interconnect parasitics on the design performance and approaches to cope with them is treated substantial attention is devoted to the discussion of sequential circuits clocking approaches and memories the course will be concluded with a discussion of design methodologies significant emphasis is placed on the use of cad tools spice and magic for homework labs and projects      2 prerequisites    eecs 105 absolute requirement      3 enrollment    due to classroomsize restrictions and constraints on the labequipment the class enrollment is restricted to 76 the following priority scheme will be used when considering enrollment 1 graduating seniors 2 graduate students needing the class for prelim 3 seniors 4 juniors if you dont need the class right away please consider taking it later as we are overenrolled at present      4 course material    a new textbook is in preparation by professor rabaey titled digital integrated circuits a design perspective unfortunately the actual book is only now going to press and will not be available until late fall this text will be made available in the from of a reader from copy central on euclid chapters 15 will be for sale at the end of the first week of class chapters 6 to 11 will be available midway through the semester      5 assignments    the weekly homework assignments will be handed out in class on wednesday they are due the next week before 5pm on wednesday they can be returned either in class or deposited in a special box located in 558 cory hall next to the desk of corey schaffer      6 laboratories s11 tu 36pm s12 th 811am s13 we 112pm s14th 36pm    the laboratories are divided into software laboratories to be performed on workstations located in 111 cory hall and hardware laboratories located in 353 cory hall the software and hardware materials will be available from copy central the second week of class the first lab is the second week of the semester and is on the magic layout system      7 discussion sessions mo 45pm tu 34pm  both in 3107
