build an intel 80186based computer  containing a variety of memory and io devices the course will  cover the basic principles of system design including how various  devices operate and how they can be used to form useful computing  systems in addition you will used stateoftheart design tools  in the lab while this is primarily a hardware class you will  be expected to write software in 80186 assembly language and to  become familiar with hardware prototyping tools  grading policy         1 labs reports are due one week after the lab work is  complete at the beginning of your next lab period lab hardware  demos are due at the end of lab period  eg the  end of the second lab period for a two week lab the ta however  may grant an extension allowing hardware demo any time before  your
