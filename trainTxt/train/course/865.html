computer architecture i  fall 19961997 offering  instructor mark d hill  and ta jeff shabel  url       computer architecture is the science and art of selecting and  interconnecting hardware components to create a computer that meets  functional performance and cost goals  this course qualitatively and  quantitatively examines computer design tradeoffs  we will learn for  example how uniprocessors execute many instructions concurrently  and why stateoftheart memory systems are nearly as complex as processors      examining tradeoffs requires that you already know how to design a  correct computer as is taught is the important prerequisite csece  552  cs 537 is also a prerequisite but it is less important and may  be taken concurrently or adequately covered with external

examine a modest extension to a paper  studied in class or simply revalidate the data in some paper by  writing your own simulator alternatively you may work in a group of  two to write a paper that surveys an area within computer  architecture  projects will include an oral presentation and a paper         assignment        examinations  there will be two midterm exams but no final exam  the midterms are  listed in in the approximate outline  please advise me of any  conflicts with these likely exam times before the end of the second  week of classes    homework  there will be several assignments  many assignments will require the  review of material that is touched upon but not covered in depth in  class  assignments will not be weighted equally  the approximate  weights of each assignment will be specified when the assignment is  handed out  assignments will be due in class on the due date  no late  assignments will be accepted except under extreme nonacademic  circumstances discussed with the instructor at least one week before  the assignment is due         homework 0 do not turn in but you may optionally do it to refresh your knowledge  homework 1 from fall 1994
