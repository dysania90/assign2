informal text book for the course maintained by volunteers   this is a compressed version of the postscript file feel free to download it and print it in the science center however we recommend that you purchase a printed and bound copy from the sourcebook center in the basement of the science center i tried printing this once and it took hours plus i had to hole punch the  hardcopy  myself that ate up an afternoon my book was also twice  as bulky because i did not want to fiddle with printing double sided  make life easy buy the book            lisp links       we will try to place interesting lisp related materials in this section      clisp for linux this is   a userfriendly common lisp implementation that many of  the tfs prefer on their own systems for special instructions  on how to install this if you are using elf binaries   consult this    lisp faq    online common lisp manual you can       search this file for descriptions of the common lisp       functions and macros    cs51 lisp style guide   word70 postscript         spim links      michael barrientos has kindly contributed  instructions on how one can properly configure spim to run on linux machines
