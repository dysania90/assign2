    prerequisites      mathematics m343 and one of m303 or m301 and a working knowledge of fortran c or c  students should be able to write and run programs under a unix operating system     textbook    iterative methods for sparse linear systems  by yousef saad      this is intended as a reference work and the material covered in this  course is not identical to that in the textbook       office hours  same as on the home page  mon  wed 900  1000 am      course description  this course is for students in the sciences and applied mathematics whose research involves solving  large sparse linear systems on a computer and for computer scientists interested in learning  the computational problems encountered in scientific and engineering codes  sparse linear systems occur in most large scale physical modeling  programs and often the setting up and solution of them accounts for the majority of the computer time  this course will focus on practical methods and their computer implementation  with a minimal amount of the underlying mathematical theory    high level tools will be used in order to quickly implement and test methods  existing software will also be used whenever possible  to avoid building everything from scratch and to learn how to use existing software resources  course goals include the ability to understand the influence of computer  architecture on the choice of methods and data structures  the strengths and weaknesses of basic methods common sources of large sparse linear systems  and the resulting implications for choosing methods and implementations  students will finish the semester with a toolkit of solvers that they can  then use for solving scientific problems for   probing computer architectures or  for obtaining a deeper understanding of the methods commonly used in  scientific computing        tentative course outline     a quick start everything you knew about solving linear systems from your linear algebra course   introduction

of a jaundiced eye                   class newsgroup    the course newsgroup accscib573 will be  used to post announcements assignments corrections and any exceptions  to usual office hours  use it to post  questions related to the course or share related information with the  class  you are responsible for checking the newsgroup frequently since  any changes or corrections to assignments will appear there    grading policies  grades are based on projects involving writing andor analyzing computer programs  written reports are required for these projects  each assignment will have questions intended to begin your thinking process  not end it  grading will also be based on the questions you raise and answer in these projects  for example if the question is which of the methods a and b is faster  simply saying a is not sufficient  you should also ask the underlying  question what measure of fast is appropriate here  why is a faster etc  most projects you can tackle in groups    however you must give full attribution for any outside sources you use for ideas software or help  also i reserve the right to call on any member of the group to  presentexplaindefendjustify the groups work and to base the  entire groups grade on that members performance  so be careful who you team up with    cheating  dont  you can get away with virtually any lifting or scavenging of material  provided you cite the source  if your citation is i photocopied another students  writeup then you wont get many points on the assignment but at least you  wont be branded with a scarlet p and tarred and feathered        assignments    assignments will be given often a total of 1015 will  be given depending on the chunk size of each one         assignment 1    assignment 2    assignment 3
