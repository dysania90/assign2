students and undergraduates have formed a group called wics women in computer science  one of the groups goals is to encourage more women to become computer science majors  so if there are any women in this class who would like to talk to someone about majoring in computer science or doing graduate studies in computer science or if there are any women who would like some extra help with their classwork they should see suzan a computer science grad student during her office hours or email her to make an appointment suzans email address is stoddercswiscedu and her office hours are tuesday

computer sciences and statistics      the c language   cs 367 will be taught using the c programming language and you will be required to do your programming assignments in c we didnt choose c just to make your life more difficult most people who become fluent in c think it is far superior to c or pascal the use of c is growing tremendously in the field and the odds are that if you ever have to write another program after this course ends you will be able to write it in c  the same statement is not true about pascal  c is also widely available but after an initial startup period you will be more productive in c than in c if you go on to take more computer science courses with few exceptions you will be required to use c in those courses   text  the text book for this course is  data abstraction and problem solving with c walls and mirrors   by frank m carrano isbn  0805312269 this is a wellwritten text that covers most but not all of the material in this course it also includes a lot about c so a separate text for the language is not necessary for my lectures i will often but not always be following   cs 367 lecture notes  fall 1993  by david j dewitt these notes are actually considerably more complete that simple lecture notes but they are still short of a true text book there is very little narrative text no exercises etc as a recommended additional source you may want to purchase these notes which are available from the doit documentation desk near the dayton street entrance of the computer sciences building 1210 w dayton st    if this is the first experience with unix for you you will need some information about activating your account logging in creating editing and manipulating files and compiling running and debugging programs the handout cs 1000 available from the doit information desk where the dewitt notes are available contains all the key information you will find it invaluable see also the  help section below    as i mentioned above the lectures will often follow the dewitt notes although i may supplement them with a few handouts during the course of the semester nonetheless  you are responsible for all material covered in lecture  the exams will be based on the lecture material reading assignments in the notes and the course assignments  grading  there will be one or two evening exams during the course of the semester a final exam and five programming assignments the exams will determine 50 of the final grade with approximately equal weight for each one and the programming assignments will count for 10 each    exams     exam 1

be your picture from your 1st birthday nor should it be the one from that boygirl scout trip in the summer of 1984 other than that it can be color or blackandwhite any size etc  no grade will be given without a photo    programming assignments  proficiency in a programming language pascal c c or fortran at the introductory level is assumed  the equivalent uwmadison prerequisite course is cs 302      assignments must be done in c on the designated machines  these are in the machine rooms on the first floor of the cs building  i encourage you to use these machines    if you prefer to use a home computer you may do so with certain restrictions you must have a c compiler on your home machine  you must log on to your university account often to read email and get copies of data files finally we will require that you turn in your c program electronically via email so if you work at home you must make provisions to download your programs to your university account and to make sure that they compile and run with the g compiler on the sparcstations    i often use electronic mail to notify students of changes in assignments hints for programs etc  i assume that you will read all electronic mail that i send   late policy  no late assignment will be accepted assignments must be turned in exactly when they are due in order to avoid lateness caused by machine loads coincident due dates for several classes etc simply be sure to get started right away on each assignment things are certain to go wrong now and then so dont wait until the last minute to start any exceptions must be approved by me and you will need a very good excuse if you get into trouble see me as soon as possible   cheating  the computer science department takes a very hard line stance on cheating you are welcome to communicate with each other on design of algorithms and data structures but  there is to be no sharing of code     you are also expected to learn understand and obey the computer systems lab policies governing your computer accounts  help  if you are having problems with the course work or programs please let me know as early in the semester as possible   office hours policies if you need help debugging a program the best way to get help is to visit any one of the cs 367 tas  during his office hours taking along a current hard copy of your program my office hours are intended as a time for me to reexplain concepts that i have presented in class but about which you are still confused or to answer your specific questions about course material i encourage you to use email as a reliable way to contact me about any problems  i read and respond to email several times daily almost every day of the week   program grading  programs are graded on all of the following criteria   correctness the program should behave correctlynormally on typical input  the program should behave as stated in the project specifications  clarity  the program should be easy to read and understand see the notes on  style  below for more information about clarity  robustness  correct behavior in extreme or unusual situations the program should handle such situations in a reasonable and logical manner that is it should not simply blow up  quality of test data  the test data for the program should demonstrate all facets of the programs capabilities including unusual cases    efficiency  avoid unnecessarily inefficient algorithms or constructs however efficiency should never be pursued at the expense of clarity  modularity  the program should be modular and should make effective use of parameters  completeness  you should incorporate all information into your  program  there should be no need for any sort of extra paper documentation  generality the program should be as general as possible subject to consideration of efficiency and clarity you should avoid arbitrary limitations such as a bound on the size or complexity of the input whenever possible when limitations are necessary they should be expressed as defined constants near the top of the program so that they can be easily changed the only numeric literals that should appear in your program are those values not very likely to change such as 0 1 or 31415926535   style    use meaningful identifier names  use a consistent naming scheme for identifier names a suggested convention is as follows    int variablename    int functionnameint argument    const int definedconstant  1234    enum enumtype  value1 value2     class classname     do not put multiple statements on a single line  skip lines between functional groups of code  use a clear and consistent indentation style see the dewitt notes for a suggested style   indent continued statements if loops  etc  line up s and s  label s meaningfully eg    while done    external documentation  this should be included as a long comment at the beginning of your program  it is addressed to both the typical user and to someone who wants to know superficially how the program works    include your full name and student id at the beginning of the comment   give a general description of what the program does  tell how to use the program how to call it format of data  give limitations bugs special features and assumptions made describe negative as well as positive aspects of the program if you dont include negatives we will assume you were unaware of them   information included in the assignment about the problem description need not be repeated but may be briefly summarized for the first point above a statement referring the user to the assignment document is then sufficient note that this only applies to the problem description  internal documentation  there are four main types of internal documentation   headers comments at the headers of functions classes and major data structures should describe their purpose assumptions about their parameters and the main outline of any algorithms they use  declarations  comments next to a declaration of a variable or data member should provide extra information not conveyed by the identifiers name the name of a variable should tell as much about it as is possible without making it too long additional information can be supplied by a comment  for example      int top  index of last element added to stack  you should use comments to explain parameters as well as local variables   within segments of code  tricky or opaque sections of code should be avoided but sometimes they are necessary  in such cases a comment can help the reader understand whats going on  between segments of code  these comments clarify the toplevel outline of your algorithm     using unix and vi  many people working with unix for the first time will find that it takes some time to become comfortable with it this is particularly true if your only previous programming experience is with pascal using  macpascal on a macintosh  i strongly urge you to put in the time early in the semester to become comfortable with unix  while this time may be painful it is time well spent also you may wish to attend a unix tutorial they will be held in rooms 1240 comp sci in two sessions on each of the following days tba you will want to pick up a copy of   cs 1000 before you go    the program development cycle   the program development cycle in a unix environment is   for       edit your program              vi programc     compile your program           g wall g  programc     if there are compilation errors         continue     run your program               aout lt inputfile gt outputfile     look at your output            vi outputfile                                    or more outputfile     if there are no errors         break     if you are too tired to continue   print a listing to take home                   pr programc inputfile outputfile  lpr  goto home          debug the program                                    gdb aout                                    run                                                                        quit  youre done  turn in the result     submission instruction to be given out later        yanniscswiscedu    mon aug 19 172814 cdt 1996
