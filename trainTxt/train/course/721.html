languages wilsonclass page  this is the home page for  paul wilsons cs345 class     this page is under construction  things are subject to change  because things may change you should hit the reload button in your browser when you come to this page to make sure youre seeing the most recent version      online course readings and reference material        syllabus       lecture notes on  declarative programming        course notes on scheme and its implementation in html for web browsing     these notes are under construction  only the first few sections are reasonably well indexed for browsing and the later sections will change as the course goes along  reading far ahead of the class is likely to be an adventure     i suggest that you use this web page with a browser while using a scheme system interactively  especially while working through chapter 3 the tutorial  this will allow you to cut text out of the document and paste it into a running scheme system     there are errors in this text especially the later chapters  thats another reason to read the html version with a browser rather than printing out a hardcopy  ill correct most of the errors before we get to those chapters        the r4rs scheme language definition  in html format for online browsing  this lists all of the standard features of scheme and tersely describes what they do  for most stuff in this course my scheme course notes will be more helpful but if you want to know about miscellanous functions and exactly what they do this is the authority      first set of   practice questions   theres also a version with   answers        second set of   practice questions   theres also a version with   answers         quiz 1 with answers        third set of   practice questions   theres also a version with   answers         notes on naming conventions and indenting for scheme which you should consult when doing homework so that i can read your code and grade it sensibly and  notes on drawing data structures       homework assignment on writing merge sort in scheme and   my solutions to the first three problems  commented scheme code       notes on a simple reader including regular expressions bnf grammar and the actual code in scheme       scheme code for a simple backwardchaining propositional calculus theorem prover which is essentially a little subset of prolog and a set of  rules for classifying animals ie a logic program about kinds of animals to play with using the theorem prover       a picture of some class objects and instances  to illustrate the simple object system from the scheme notes and   another picture showing class objects and the metaclass object illustrating the circularity that makes the latter selfdescribing       scheme code for a simple objectbased programming system  based on classes and generic procedures inheritance not implemented yet       notes on type systems including inheritance and subtyping       takehome quiz and the   answers and some explanations       test 2 and a version of   test 2 with answers and some explanations       the main language well be using in this course is  scheme  and by default the implementation to use is  rscheme  which is installed on the public cs sparcs running solaris and rs6000s running aix  on the cs machine you run rscheme with the command  pbinrunscheme      if you use your own machine and youre running linux or solaris or any of several other implementations of unix you can get rscheme and install it on your machineits free  you can find it from  donovan kolblys home page   be sure to get version 07 or later and ask the ta zhu qing for a patch to make it friendlier for newbies     if youre using your own machine and its a mac i recommend getting gambit marc feeleys implementation of scheme  its free too  you can get it from the scheme repository see below     if youre using a pc running windows or dos im not sure what the best scheme to get is  there are a bunch available at the scheme repository  do not  use mit scheme or guiletheyre not standard scheme you might try gambitc by mark feeley or mzscheme from rice     if you use something besides rscheme i recommend getting the meroon  version 3 object system from the scheme repository when we start doing objectoriented programming  for a few assignments you may have to use rscheme under unix to take advantage of rschemes object system but for most things you should be able to use meroon      the scheme repository   the  scheme repository  at the university of indiana has lots of free implementations of scheme and various documents on scheme  if you get interested in learning more about scheme than we cover in this class thats the place to look   complangscheme   there is an internet newsgroup devoted to scheme complangscheme    the main language well be using in this course is  scheme  and by default the implementation to use is  rscheme  which is installed on the public
