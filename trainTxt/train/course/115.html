spring 96 tuth 115  230 gates 100       this course covers the fundamental techniques for designing and analyzing geometric algorithms in two three and higher dimensions we will give an indepth coverage of basic geometric data structures such as convex hulls arrangements voronoi and delaunay diagrams flat and hierarchical triangulations partition trees etc we will also survey several important paradigms of geometric algorithm design including sweep lineplane methods randomized techniques cuttings and their applications parametric searching and various geometric optimization methods we will motivate the material with example problems drawn from application areas such as robotics graphics vision and geography and discuss some of the nontrivial issues involved in

cover all the basic techniques nevertheless given some algorithmic preparation we can cover lots of ground even in one quarter below is a list of topics to be coveredbut we do not promise to cover

text   the main text for the course is a reader comprised of a number of survey articles plus lecture notes scribed with the help of students in previous years of this class a second recommended reader is a preprint of the forthcoming book computational geometry by example by mark de berg mark van kreveld mark overmars and otfried schwarzkopf this book uses examples from application areas to motivate all the main structures and techniques of computational geometry and may become the main text for this course in future years  these two readers are available at the stanford bookstore     homeworks exams grading etc   the course will have three substantial and mathematically challenging homeworks of the pencilandpaper type there will be no final exam but there will be a midterm whose function will be to test breath but not depth  for the final grade we will count each of the homeworks and the midterm as 25 of the grade please do the homeworkthere is no other way to learn the
