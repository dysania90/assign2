announcements etc                eecs 482 is an introductory course in operating systems at senior  undergraduate level or firstyear graduate level   the objective of the course is to familiarize you with   the issues involved in the design and implementation  of modern operating systems the concepts discussed are  applicable to a variety of systems however we will discuss many  examples that are drawn from historically significant and modern  operating systems including multics unix mach and windows nt          topics to be discussed include processes and threads interprocess  communication  concurrency and synchronization deadlocks  communication in distributed systems including remote procedure  calls cpu scheduling virtual memory management inputoutput systems   disk scheduling file systems and protection and security          students are expected to have extensive programming experience prior  to this course knowledge of the cc programming language and  familiarity with unix is required             prerequisites           computer organization eecs 370   and data structures eecs 380 are essential         class textbook          operating system concepts 4th edition by silberchatz and glavin  addisonwesley     supplemental reading material and notes provided during the semester       other suggested textbooks          advanced programming in the unix environment by stevens addisonwesley   modern operating systems by tanenbaum prenticehall          assignments         you will complete four programming projects working individually or  in groups of two your decision relating to the implementation of  operating systems all the programming will be in the c or c  programming language you should be prepared to spend substantial  amount of time on the readings and on programming projects      there will also be several homework assignments to be done individually      grading          grades will be based on two exams four programming assignments and  several homeworks according to the following tentative weightage         homeworks 15    midterm 20    final  25    four programming projects 40        from my experience in teaching software courses in the past most  people do very well on programming projects so exams and homeworks  end up being the distinguishing factors that determine the grade for  most students  on the other hand doing poorly on the programming  projects is a sure way to fail the course        also note that your grade is only determining your performance during  the term it is not determining your future potential how well you  will be able to apply the course in your employment etc  and in the  end how well you do in the future is what really matters  so it is  important to not lose sight of the bigger picture beyond  grades instead simply focus on doing the course to the best of your  potential and making sure to take advantage of tas any myself to learn  the material many employers treat the knowledge of the material in  the course as being a true test of an experienced software practioner       policy on collaboration         unethical behavior such as copyingmodifying someone elses project  assignment code looking into other students directories for material  when they do not expect you to copying homeworks etc is not  permissible        on the other hand you are encouraged to discuss homework problems and  project assignments with each other that fosters learning and most of  the work in computer industry is done as a team effort in such a  case please write the names of the students you discussed homeworks  or projects on your submissions however note that the homework  solutions or actual code must not be shared homeworks must be written  individually and any code submitted must be yours unless instructors  permission is taken and the source acknowledged       class communication tools       we will use a variety of mechanisms to communicate within the  class most will have links from the       eecs 482 home page  at   tools will  include class newsgroup an experimental javabased chat facility   and of course email also we will attempt to provide  most of the handouts online
