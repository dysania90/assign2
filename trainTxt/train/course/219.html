        spring 1996          cis 841 se 750ks software validation and verification          spring 1996          whats new on these web pages     the final exam is now online   homework assignment 3 part b is now online   someone asked for a clarification regarding data flow criteria  it appears i misspoke in discussing a hint on collecting data for  assignment 3 part a  here is the clarification      the alldupaths criteria requires that all paths between all defs   and all uses it reaches be exercised      the alluses criteria requires some path between all defs and all  uses it reaches be exercised    the alldefs criteria requires some path between all defs and some  uses it reaches be exercised    to summarize for all definitions        criteria     num uses        paths to uses      alldu          all               all      alluses        all              some      alldefs       some              some    note that some is satisfied by one     i know that some of you are having significant technical problems  with the course  by this i mean delays in receiving tapes receiving  blank tapes and variability in the audio quality of tapes  id  like to try to assess how widespread this is  if i find that  it is a problem for a significant number of you i plan on   complaining to ntu  im not sure if it will do any good but its  worth a try  so send me your feedback    if you have any other comments on the way the course is being  taught please feel free to let me know it will not affect your grade                  overview      as software systems increase in size and complexity the difficulty  of assuring that they function as intended increases rapidly  a variety of approaches have been proposed that have the  potential to enable development organizations  and individual developers to produce higher quality  software      in general no single technique is capable of providing  incontrovertable proof that software always behaves as  intended      in this course we will examine different verification  and validation approaches that are capable of  providing us with evidence of software quality  using a combination of these techniques can provide   a highdegree of confidence in the quality of the software  we construct        lectures      durland 164   mw 330445 pm   exams held in nichols 236         instructor      prof matt dwyer           prerequisites      cis 740        requirements      the course will consist of lectures readings homework assignments  and examinations  the bulk of the concepts in the course will  be presented explained and illustrated by way of extended  examples in the lectures  the readings serve to provide more  details and depth on selected concepts  homework is designed  to develop students abilities to apply concepts and synthesize  solutions to new problems based on those concepts            lectures   and readings  lectures and readings function  as an integrated presentation of the course material  it is  expected that readings will be read prior to the appropriate  lecture        homework   there will be four homework assignments  the  assignments will involve applying and extending the concepts  presented in the lectures and readings  for some of the homeworks  you will be required to apply specific techniques to actual  code  for these assignments i will make samples  of code available that you can use alternatively you can  use a piece of code that you have developed      homeworks should be completed individually  do not work with any  other person  assignments are due at the beginning of class  10will be deducted for late assignments an additional 10  for each day late  offcampus students may either  email their solutions to me or fax  their solutions using 9135327353        examinations   there will be a comprehensive takehome final exam             final grades will be assigned based on the following weighting  homeworks 40 midterm 20 and final 40            readings      the required readings for this course are selected papers from the literature          references          if you do not have access to these papers they have been collected  and are available from copy co phone number 913 5372679  the  cost is 50      in addition to the required readings you may find the following  texts useful as they contain some of the material in the course  they range from general software engineering texts to indepth  treatments of issues related to particular verification and   validation approaches      there are a number of general software engineering  text  this text does a good job with software quaility issues  fundamentals of software engineering         c ghezzi m jazayeri and d mandrioli         prenticehall          the following two texts cover a broad range of   testing techniques and contain significant practical  information for testers  software testing techniques         b beizer         van nostrand reinhold         the craft of software testing         b marick         prenticehall          representations and algorithms for data flow analysis are  covered in most compiler books  a good example is   compilers  principles techniques and tools         av aho r sethi and jd ullman         addisonwesley                  additional resources      web pages for course linked off of  my home page will   include assignments solutions lecture notes and links  to other validation and verification pages        organization amp schedule      the course is broken up into the following parts  foundations  of program analysis    we cover mathematical preliminaries   how validation  and verification activities relate to other software  development activities   we present and discuss a variety of models that are  used to represent  and reason about the possible behavior of a program      specification  of intended program behavior  how do  we say what a program should do      while there are a variety of different specification formalisms  in this course we will focus on finite state automata specifications        static techniques  examine the text of designs specifications or code  one can view static techniques as a kind of abstract execution  of the program  this execution produces different kinds of output  than the normal program execution and that output is used to  drive validation and  verification efforts  this execution  can be accomplished on a variety of different substrates  we will study both  manual  techniques that use developers to perform program analyses    automated  techniques that algorithmically perform program analyses               dynamic techniques  involve executing an implementation with  respect to the semantics of the language in which it is written  validation and verification efforts are based on observing the  behaviour of the software as it executes  this can include  observing normal program output as well as probing the state  of the software during different points in its execution  well look at techniques based on both of these  assertion based  analyses involve periodic checking of intended behavior during program execution    testing  involves checking of software inputoutput relationships               software processes  that support verification and validation  provide an infrastructure in which quality assurance activities can  be organized monitored and controlled      software safety  in lifecritical systems is emerging as an increasingly  important area of quality  assurance      concurrency  is being used increasingly in distributed and parallel  software  along with increased performance comes an increase in the  complexity of the already difficult  problem of quality assurance  we will consider the impact of concurrency  on both static and dynamic analysis approaches                             dwyercisksuedu
