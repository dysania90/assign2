query languages postrelational database systems and theory of transactions management      it is strongly recommended that you have had a course which covers the principles of database systems  furthermore programming experience with c is expected     programming assignments will involve sybase a relational database management system coral a deductive database programming language postgres an objectrelational database management system and exodus or shore an objectoriented storage manager  if time permits we will also use ode an objectoriented database management system information about these systems is maintained in the database group homepage at  these database systems are maintained in the database laboratory lh 401a by the database lab systems assistant sudhir rao

conference of very large databases offer papers of the most recent research in databases  these journals and proceedings are available at swain library       required readings from textbooks  the course lectures will come mostly from material in the three textbooks  the chapters of these textbooks which are crucial to this course are given below  i will try to make it clear what readings

your classmates but we expect the work you actually hand in to be your own     as the assignments are given the hypertext version of this course description will be updated to contain links to the assignment description       assignment 1   data for assignment 1   new data for assignment 1   assignment 2  assignment 3     communication  the course newsgroup acc646 will be used to post announcements such as assignments exams and any exceptions to my usual office hours  you are also encouraged to use it to post questions related to the course or share related information with the class  make a habit of looking for new notes a few times each week     this course description is accessible as an html hypertext markup language file on the www world wide web by accessing the computer science departments home page  and following the link for c646  it will be updated with additional information such as programming assignments as the course progresses      tasks and grade distribution    assignments 40 these assignments will involve programming in postrelational database systems  two exams each worth 30 these will be take home exams and will deal with the theoretical aspects of the course      policies  academic integrity  read the computer science departments statement on academic integrity to be sure you understand the rules under which computer science courses operate  cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the office of student ethics a branch of the office of the dean of students      withdrawal  wednesday october 25 is the last day until 4 pm to drop a course or withdraw from all courses with an automatic w  after that date a student may withdraw only with the permission of his or her dean this approval is normally only for urgent reasons related to extended illness or equivalent distress       wednesday november 29 is the last day for deans to approve a course drop      incomplete grade  an incomplete i final grade will be given only by prior arrangement in exceptional circumstances conforming to university and departmental policy which requires among other things that the student must have completed the bulk of the work required for the course with a passing grade and that the remaining work can be made up within 30 days after the end of the semester
