sources of information   schedule            announcements     here is the final exam  a fairly primitive program for playing with holographic reduced representations plate is at gasserappshrr on the sharkestra moose and department sgis here is enough information to get you started with it here is a new optional paper by paul rodriguez on contextfree languages and simple recurrent nets             topics  this course provides an introduction to the field of natural language processing or computational linguistics including both analysis and generation   speech processing machine translation and computational approaches to language acquisition and language evolution are also given some attention a wide range of linguistic phenomena including phonology morphology syntax and semantics and pragmatics will be treated and examples will come from various languages we will be concerned both with how well particular approaches solve practical problems and with how well they model human data    the course is divided into two relatively separate components the first deals with symbolic approaches to language processing we will cover parsing and generation algorithms emphasizing modern unificationbased approaches but will spend more of our time considering the sorts of grammars that support parsing and generation with respect to theory and notation we will stick mainly with headdriven phrase structure grammar probably the most popular approach in computational linguistics today    the second component of the course deals with statistical and connectionist approaches to language processing which despite their very different origins and motivation share many underlying mechanisms as well as a lack of builtin linguistic knowledge we will emphasize the acquisition of knowledge phonological morphological syntactic semantic temporal processing and the relation between perception and the grammarlexicon    the course schedule however will be organized around topics rather than approaches thus we will look at morphology approaches to parsing and semantic case for example in each case considering how both symbolic and connectioniststatistical approaches deal with the problem for each topic we will also look at acquisition as well as processing            coursework and prerequisites   students should have some background in ai such as c563564 and be able to program in scheme or lisp  some linguistics background would also be very helpful but is not required cognitive science students from outside of computer science are encouraged to enroll    coursework includes  project 50   this may be done in collaboration with others in the class it should include a running program though this can be based on existing software in the case of connectionist models and a report which relates the work to other work in the area an attempt will be made to relate projects to each other by constraining the type of language that is handled     grading paper 25 relevance 25 originality success lessons learned 50     suggestions for projects    a simple story you might want to use for your project    exams 40   there will be two exams each covering half of the course you need only take the portion of each exam covering the approach symbolic or connectioniststatistical which is not related to your project    discussion of papers 10   students will be responsible for leading discussion of some of the papers we will be reading heres a schedule   readings for the class will be kept on reserve in swain library  a copy will also be left in a box in the
