course overview      from the course catalog       techniques for attacking solving and writing computer programs for  challenging computational problems  algorithmic and programming  language toolkits      what the course is about      the course is intended to provide practice for participation in the acm  programming contest  the regional contest will be held on november  16th at several sites this year duke is a site    people in cps 149s are expected to participate in the  contest  the top two teams in the region go to the world finals  this years finals will be held in san jose ca  on march 2 1997          syllabus            each week three problems will be assigned  we anticipate ten weeks  of problems with some time off for fall break and for the regional  contest  thus a total of 30 problems will be assigned  we will try to  make one of the problems each week a challenge  the other two problems  will be easier but still require an effort to get completely correct            grading         coded solutions will be graded on a scale of 0 2 6 10  a 10 point  solution solves all input test files correctly  a 6 point solution  solves some test files but not all  a 2 point solution represents an  honest effort at an attempt but may not solve the problem for any  test data  an honest effort is subject to interpretation but we  anticipate that it represents at least two hours of work       problems done individually earn full credit  for group solutions the  points earned are split among the group members so that a perfect  solution for a twoperson group earns each person 5 points         two cutoffs have been established 120 points earns an a 80 points  earns a b  we might lower these cutoffs but we will not raise them  each student must also make one presentation of a solution  failure to  present a solution will cause a 10 point deduction in total points       students participating in the regional contest can earn points for  problems solved in the contest  we may give full credit for all  problems solved to each team member  rather than dividing credit among team members         assignments     each assignment should include a readme file with the names of all group  members or just one name if an individual attempt and the time it took to  complete  turn in only one program for each group attempt         first week        html parsing
