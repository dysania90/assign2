havent done so but still want to remain in the  course please see me       ma 293 discrete mathematics 1     cs 112 or cs 113 programming amp data structures in c          topics  this course is a core requirement in undergraduate computer science  curriculums at most colleges  its purpose is threefold first to  encourage you to investigate the nature of computation second to further  develop your formal reasoning and writing skills and third to add new  techniques to your programming bag of tricks       accordingly we will develop several formal models of computation each  more powerful than the last  at each stage we will prove some of what our  intuition suggests and sometimes what it denies about these models  we  will also see how most models admit two very different characterizations  one of machines that are able to recognize certain events and another of  grammars that are able to generate exactly what these machines recognize        in particular we will study regular languages regular expressions finite  deterministic and nondeterministic automata contextfree grammars  pushdown automata turing machines  and more if time allows       grading      6

homeworks         homework assignments    when writing up your homework there are two goals you must keep in mind  first to give evidence that you have put real thought into the problem  and second to convince the reader that your solution is correct and  that you know why  as a programmer you have some experience with  this sort of writing an effective program must be written for both a  compiler and a human reader  similarly solutions to your problems must be  correct in the sense of solving the stated problem but they must also be  comprehensible to the grader       as with any writing the first draft of a problem solution is usually  unpresentable  all of the pieces may be there but they tend to be  chaotically assembled  the single most important thing you can do  to make your solutions presentable is to rewrite them after you have  discovered why they are correct and then to throw away or at least tuck  away your initial draft  remember scratch paper is cheap       be careful to realize that this emphasis on presentation has nothing to do  with whether english is your native language or whether you prefer to write  your solutions with pencil pen quill or word processor     a wellwritten solution starts by stating assumptions and then  works towards a clearly defined goal emphasizing the overall direction and  omitting the superfluous       late policy    in general you will have at least one week to work on a homework  assignment and at least three opportunities to attend my office hours  before that assignment is due          assignments turned in late for any reason will be marked late and will be  scored at 60 of their face value  assignments turned in more than a week  after they were due will be scored at 0 of their face value  that is we  will still attempt to evaluate them but they will not count towards your  grade  for excused lateness such as illness and family emergency see  the grading appeals section below       collaboration and plagiarism      collaborate klabrat labrashn labrativ      ratr vi ll collaboratus pp of collaborare to labor together fr      l com  laborare to labor 1 to work jointly with others esp in an      intellectual endeavor 2 to cooperate with or assist usu willingly an      enemy of ones country and esp an occupying force 3 to cooperate with an      agency or instrumentality with which one is not immediately connected       collaboration n      collaboration is encouraged primarily in the first and third senses when  working on homework problems and preparing for exams  none of the problems  in this class are intended to have secret solutions the more resourceful  you are at discovering solutions the more time you will have to write them  well  indeed if you are stuck on a problem i will be happy to talk with  you about it during office hours  however the solutions you turn in must  be your original writing  copying a prepared solution is not collaboration  at all it is plagiarism         plagiarize plajriz also je vt  to steal and pass off as      ones own the ideas or words of another to present as ones own an idea      or product derived from an existing source  plagiarizer n      plagiarizing anothers words is not tolerated at boston university  it is  so disdained that there are specific procedures for accusing and punishing  those who plagiarize  do not copy another persons work and present it as  your own       the above definitions were snatched from the webster server at bu         grading appeals  simple clerical errors will be corrected as soon as they  are brought to my attention         perhaps you will disagree about the grading of a particular problem  or feel that an instance of lateness was justified  in order to bring this  to my attention you must prepare a written appeal with supporting  documents and give it to me during the last week of class  i will  carefully consider these appeals and make reasonable adjustments to your  benefit when preparing the final grades        this is only a mechanism for dealing with my gradebook in a fair  manner  you are always welcome to approach me with your  concerns       if you dont know whether or how to write an appeal  use this as a guideline i am likely to look more kindly upon that was  just a really bad week for me than my homework was always late because  i uh had a headache          attendance    attendance is not an official part of the course grade but it is your  responsibility to stay informed  some announcements will be made only in  class         mailing list    other announcements will be made only by email  to add yourself to the  course mailing list log on to a cs cluster computer such as csa and type             csmail a cs305               the   atanasoffberry
