protocols which enable their use  for telephony and lan traffic  a large part of the grade in the class  will be based on lab projects associated with building a protocol stack   on top of atm  we will also   attempt to predict usage models for networks  in the year 2010 and analyze technology for this new era of networked computing            text   david mcdysan atm theory and application

plus 20 for each week they are overdue  a lab that is 7 days late will receive 50 credit 14 days  30 credit 21 days  10  credit  since the labs build on each other it is to your advantage to turn them in  on time      projects   the last four weeks of class will be spent on a moderate sized research      project   you may work in groups or seperately on the class project       expectations           i expect you to become conversant with the basics of atm research  this   research area should motivate you to independent reading and thinking   you will spend at least 6 hours per week in laboratory work or reading   you will need to   check the mosaic page at   often in order to get changes to assignments and updates to the schedule   all laboratory work and homework should be done independently  you may work in a group to understand the material and questions but  everything you turn in or pass off should be your work  take steps to   protect your work from being copied by read
