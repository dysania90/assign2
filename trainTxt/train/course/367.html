smaller group projects and two individual mastery projects  the mastery projects are designed to ensure that everyone who completes the course is certified as capable of writing and understanding reasonably complex c programs  since some people on the large team project may not write any c code the mastery projects are necessary for this certification one of the mastery projects will also use java  there will be at least three writtensmaller assignmentsprograms         grading        small assignments class presentation class participation    5      mastery exams    20      small group
