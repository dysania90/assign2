of artificial intelligence using common lisp 2nd edition  w h freeman 1995 ive worked hard to create an ai textbook that is   selfcontained so you dont have to purchase a separate book on lisp  you dont have to buy a separate book on ai example programs and you  dont have to purchase a separate book on the mathematical theory         online reference materials for lisp   what lisp is     the lisp faq provides the answers to many questions about lisp and  its implementations     common lisp the language 2nd edition is the standard reference  on common lisp it seems best if you access it via the tableofcontents  page rather than by trying to download the entire html file or  postscript     you can get the source code for   the lisp programs from the elements of artificial intelligence using  common lisp 2nd edition     here are some interesting links to info about how to use lisp for  programming worldwide web applications         facilities   in order to take advantage of the new
