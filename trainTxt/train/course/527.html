of the course is to gain experience with the major paradigms and data  structures used in creating algorithms and with basic methods for analyzing  the time and space requirements of programs we will cover most of the textbook the tentative schedule is       week 1              intro and ch 1 math background induction recursion   week 2              ch 2 algorithm analysis notation and techniques

final exam  there will be some small programming assignments  programming problems will usually be given as part of regular written homework assignments there will not be a separate grading category for programming assignments  class participation and effort may be taken into account in determining grades in borderline situations  the components will be weighted roughly as follows    homeworks assignments         35   midterm exams                 20 each   final exam                    25         late assignment policy     all assignments are due at the beginning of class  in other cases assignments turned in within 24 hours will receive a 20 penalty and those turned in 24 to 48 hours late will receive a 50 penalty exception  each student may turn in one homework assignment up to two days late with no penalty  regrade requests must be made within one week of when the assignments are returned in class     policy on collaboration     homework and programming assignments should be done alone  it is  reasonable to discuss general approaches to problem solution or  algorithm design with other students but the bulk of the work  must be done alone  working out details sharing in the writeup  or sharing or copying code will be treated as a violation of the  academic integrity rules     note on language for progamming assignments     program source code in the book is in pascal  however for course  programming assignments you will be free to use your choice of pascal c or  c or another language if approved by the instructor     homework assignments       homework 8 html
