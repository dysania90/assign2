computer architecture fall 1996 instructor   allen d malony url     computer architecture is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create a computer that meets functional performance and cost goals this course qualitatively and quantitatively examines computer design tradeoffs our focus will be on processor architectures memory systems and multiprocessor machines in particular we will study instructionlevel parallelism superpipelining and superscalar arisc processor design memory hierarchies cache systems and coherency mechanisms and multiprocessor architectures and parallel computing      announcements    instructor    lecture    required text    reference text    readings    lecture notes    homeworks    examinations    programming    project

bookstore  lecture notes lecture notes will be made available as they are developed see links in schedule  homework there will be two homework assignments many problems will require the review of material that is touched upon but not covered in depth in class assignments will be due in class on the due date no late assignments will be accepted except under extreme nonacademic circumstances discussed with the instructor at least one week before the assignment is due      homework 1  figure 310 and  figure 344  errata  solutions    homework 2 this has been combined with the programming assignment   examinations    midterm takehome oct 31 halloween due nov 5  please advise me of any conflicts with these likely exam times before the end of the second week of classes  programming the topic of the programming assignment is cache simulation the programming assigment is combined with the second homework assignment there are two parts    part 1 run the following trace files through the dinero cache simulator  use the dinero server found in this web page       cc1  found in dinero server options     spice  found in dinero server options     tex  found in dinero server options   show results for different levels of cache size unified and split associativity and block sizes  explain the results that you see    part 2 the following sample code models an 8 kbyte directmapped cache with 32byte lines blocks 25  it treats reads and writes in the samewas as a simple reference  included is only the routine that checks for a reference in the cache and accummulates total references and misses  not included are the io routines to read in a reference trace assuming it comes from a file or stdio and to produce output statistics   include  include   define cachesize 8192

reference  trace file    b write a routine to model a 2way and a 4way set associative cache of  the same size    c demonstrate the operation of all three simulators with three programs  of your own choosing  that is find or write three programs they  can be simple from which you can capture address references to  drive your simulators one thought is to get three linpack  codes note you need to modify the programs to capture references  concentrate only on data references    this assignment will be due on dec 3  term project the term project will be to write a paper that surveys an area within computer architecture the paper should         summarize work in an area giving extensive references 6 at least      present opinions of others for or against various options  again with references      conclude with your opinion of the strengths and weaknesses of   the arguments given    you will be graded on the completeness of your survey the accuracy of your summaries and the support you give for your opinions  some possible survey topics are         compiler transformations to improve memory behavior      superscalar amp superpipelined processors vs vliw      effect on architecture of changing technology you might consider   different types of technology      highperformance io eg for storage or network communication      contrast of stateoftheart processors      massively parallel processing systems      scalable architecture technologies      some aspect of the history of computer architecture     the topic chosen should be something that you are particularly interested in  there are many references for papers including         proc of the intl symposium on computer architecture isca      proc of the conf on architectural support for
