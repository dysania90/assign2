programming   section 2 fortran   cs 110 is a onecredit course which covers the basic programming structures needed to prepare students for cs 310 and elementary engineering courses  no prior computer programming experience is required and only a basic knowledge of computers is assumed  the material covered will enable you to write simple computer programs to solve engineering problems in elementary courses  all programming is done in fortran  this course is intended for students who received little or no programming instruction in high school    this section is taught entirely in the fortran programming language and is intended primarily for engineering students and noncomputer science majors click here for a course description     menu      important announcements  read now

topics and sections of the text will be approximately covered each week during the semester  you will only get the most out of this class if you read the relevant sections of the text before coming to class  this way you will be able to ask questions in class about anything that you are unsure of instead of waiting until youre in the lab trying to work on an assignment to discover you didnt really understand something       weeks 18      text and lecture notes  text fortran with engineering applications 5th edition by e koffman and f friedman 1993    lecture notes copies of the lecture notes will be available online at the end of each week of class important  the online lecture notes are not a substitute for coming to class and only cover what i show on the overhead projector  they do not include any examples or additional notes that i put on the board  you are responsible for all the material covered in class        week 1    week 2    week 3    week 4    week 5    week 6    week 7    week 8      programming assignments  there are four programming assignments each contributing 25 to your final grade  you must attempt to complete every programming assignment  if you hand in a program that does not run or will not even compile without errors then it will not be graded and will automatically receive a zero grade and you risk failing the course        gradesheets    handin

consultants     the consultants in the computer lab can help you with most problems  they wear name tags and are on duty from approximately 800 am to 1100 pm  consultants can answer short questions about compiler error messages and program syntax as well as how to login use the printers send email run netscape etc             click here for more information about the consultants                  instructor    general questions about an assignment or questions that may require a long explanation are best answered by myself  please see me during office hours or send me email  i am not normally in my office except during office hours because i do my dissertation research from home via a modem  therefore if you want to see me outside of office hours please make an appointment first  you can most easily contact me by email because i regularly login and read my email from home             click here to send me email                problem solving exercises  one of the most important skills you will learn in this class is problem solving  good problem solving skills distinguish a good computer programmer from a bad one  it doesnt matter how familiar or skilled you are in a particular programming language if you do not understand how to solve the problem then you will not be able to write a computer program for it in any language    to help you learn problem solving skills and techniques i will assign weekly problem solving exercises  these will be small but nontrivial problems which i will give out each monday  you should look at the problem and think about it during the week and right down the steps you would go through to solve the problem ie the overall structure of your program  this is primarily an exercise in general problem solving so you do not have to write any fortran code though you may if you want to and have time and your solutionalgorithm should not even be dependent on a particular programming language such as fortran  we will go over the solution

microsoft windows and microsoft fortran  this lab is open from 700 am to 100 am seven days a week except certain holidays  the printer room is located across the hall in rm 1359    you may also use your home or dorm computers to write your programs however you will probably have to purchase your own copy of microsoft fortran or lahey personal fortran see the inside cover of the textbook  you may also work in any of the other computer labs on campus however most do not have fortran compilers please see me first before using the cae lab    the software you will be using in the lab includes
