the course will focus on both general classes of algorithms such as dynamic programming divide and conquer and greedy methods and advanced data  structures such as balanced trees graphs and heaps  in addition we  will compare different algorithms formally by analyzing their complexity ie running time  the problems we will study involve sorting searching graph algorithms computational geometry and a sprinkling of other topics which vary from year to year        prerequisites    the official prerequisite for this course is cs109ab introduction to computer science or equivalent  although this course will be entirely a penandpaper course ie no programming familiarity with programming concepts such as pointers arrays records procedures and recursion will be assumed  in addition a solid background in mathematics will prove invaluable for this course in that we will argue formally about the correctness and performance of almost every algorithm and data structure  introduced  the ability to write clear formal and brief proofs will be relied upon especially by the ta        course staff     professor  serge plotkin                    email                plotkincsstanfordedu
