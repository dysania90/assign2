introduces students to the basic concepts of systems  programming including system calls files and io process  management interprocess communication networking concurrent  programming and graphics using x windows  particular  emphasis will be placed on the implementation of these concepts in  unix but other operating system implementations will also be covered      prerequisites students are assumed to be able to program in c and  to have a basic understanding of data structures and assembler language  programming    grading  there will be two tests and six programming  assignments  each of the tests will count 24 of the course grade  the program assignments will be of varying weights depending on  their degree of difficulty but they will total 52  there will be no makeup exams  however there will be an optional  comprehensive final exam which can be used to replace a missing test or  project or your lowest test or project      academic integrity all programs submitted must be your own work  and you are expected to develop your programs independently  you may  receive as much help as you wish on the use of the operating system  text editors debuggers file transfer protocols and so on  you may  consult with other members of the class about interpreting the  assignment and you may get help in finding bugs but not fixing bugs  but you are not allowed to look at or copy another persons code or  discuss design decisions with others and you cannot show your code to  others  students found to be in violation of these guidelines will  fail the project and will be reported to the dean      programming assignments this is a programming intensive course  and students are expected to be strong c programmers  assignments may  be done in either c or c  while you may use whatever platforms or  compilers you wish to develop your code all code submitted must run  on both sun and aix platforms on rcs and must compile without errors  or significant warnings using gcc wall  assignments will  be submitted by emailing source code to the ta multiple files should  be bundled using  shar  you must submit a make file with each  assignment  there will be ten point per day penalty for lateness    schedule  this schedule is tentative and should not be taken too literally  i will sometimes be ahead of this sometimes   behind it and sometimes completely off of it

projects    general project guidelines  all projects should follow  guidelines for good programming practices  here is my list     your program should have a comment at the top with your name  login id a brief description of what the program is and any  special compiling instructions   main should be like an executive in a company it  should not do any work but it should delegate work to other functions   most functions should be short and each should do only one thing  no function should ever be more than 50 lines   each function should have a brief comment describing what it  does   it is not necessary to comment every line and if your code is well  written it should not require a lot of inline commenting  however  you should use comments to describe any unusual code or hard to follow  code or complicated code and describe any nonobvious variables   variables and functions should have meaningful names but you can  use single letters like i for loop counters and such   you should check the return code for any system call that can  fail and have an appropriate error handler   your code should have enough error checking so that no matter  what the user does your program will not seg fault or loop forever  or do other strange things  it is very hard to  make your program idiot proof idiots are very clever   all code must be written by you and you alone except that you  can use and modify any sample code from the text or from class as long  as you provide credit to the source             about project 1     about project 2     about project 3     about project 4     about project 5     about project 6            if you have problems or suggestions  send mail to   sysprogcsrpiedu            miscellaneous resources    at the request of one of the students here is a link to   a list of all of the   rfcs request for comments  this contains protocols for many common  network services as well as other standards for the internet
