assignments  tools  examinations  acknowledgments    overview  this course provides an introduction to the principles underlying the design of both modern and legacy programming languages  by developing a series of interpreters that study various characteristics of programming languages students will obtain a deep understanding of language semantics  such understanding provides a firm basis for selecting a language for a particular task and for graduate study in programming languages and compilers  to a lesser degree this course will also cover programming paradigms implementation concerns and formal specification of programming language semantics      previous cs 441 courses at princeton were taught using kamins book and involved writing interpreters in pascal while this course is similar in content we will be developing interpreters in scheme not only is scheme better suited to this task but using scheme will give students some firsthand experience with an advanced programming language  course topics from academic calendar  principles theory and implementation of modern programming languages  name binding macros parameter passing and closures continuations coroutines and objects  types modules and representation independence  compilation by transformation  lambda calculus operational semantics and denotational semantics    class information

lecture notes  lecture notes for each class will be typeset and appear online one or two days after each class    lecture notes    assignments  one assignment will be due each week  most assignments will involve implementing some language facility in an interpreter  assignments will be available thursday and due the following thursday at the beginning of class  solutions will be discussed in class after assignments are collected hence late assignments will not be accepted  solutions will also be posted online      assignments will be graded for both content and style where style has a specific meaning that should become clear in class  since there are two points per assignment the grades are simple right 2 close 1 and wrong 0    assignments and solutions    tools  scheme is our most important tool  here are some useful scheme links         r4rs scheme definition  mit scheme  scheme home page at mit        indiana scheme repository   we are using mit scheme for this course here are a few useful things to know about mit scheme  to get started type scheme in a shell to start a scheme readevalprint loop  you can now type definitions and expressions interactively or load files using load filescm even if you are familiar with emacs you may want to do the first assignment this way alternatively you can run scheme under emacs      for the interpreters well be building in this course you need to install a few extensions to scheme      even if you dont run scheme under emacs you probably want to edit scheme programs using emacs because it has nice automatic indentation facilities  a better indentation style than the default can be enabled by placing      setq loadpath cons ucs441emacs loadpath  in a file called emacs in your home directory   examinations  the following is a tentative schedule for cs 441 examinations    scheme quiz in class during the week of feb 12  midterm exam the week of march 11  final exam may 15  may 23   here is a study guide for
