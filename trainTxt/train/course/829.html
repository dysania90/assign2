objectives  present the concepts of data structures in general and some of the most widely used structures in detail data structures are the fundamental building  blocks of computer programs by the end of the course you should be able to identify situations in which a data structure is necessary determine the  requirements for the data structure and select the appropriate data structure from those covered in this course reiterate the concepts of structure programming abstract data types and modularity these principles which were introduced in cs302 are essential  to writing clear correct and maintainable software as there is a close connection between abstract data types and data structures this course places  a strong emphasis on applying these principles in all programming exercises  teaching assistants   wei zhang and chin tang chin are the teaching assistants tas for this course sections 2 and 3 they will grade your homework assignments and will be happy to answer questions about the assignments or any other aspect of the course that is giving you trouble   wei zhang  office 1343 compuer sciences  office hours wednesday 1011 thursday 910 sunday 34  office phone 2625596

home page         text   the text book for this course is data abstraction and problem solving with c walls and mirrors by frank m carrano isbn  0805312269  this is a wellwritten if a little longwinded text that covers most but not all of the material in this course it also includes background about c so a  separate text for the language is not necessary   the lectures will often but not always follow david dewitts cs 367 lecture notes  fall 1995 these notes are far more complete that simple lecture  notes but they fall short of a true text book they contain very little narrative text no exercises etc i am using these notes as a basis for my lectures as  such i feel free to skip portions and cover additional material you may want to purchase these notes which are available from the doit documentation  desk at the dayton street entrance of the computer sciences building 1210 w dayton st    if this course is your first experience with unix you will need information about activating your account logging in creating editing and manipulating files  and compiling running and debugging programs the handout cs 1000 also available from the doit information desk contains this crucial information  also see also the help section below lecture information    tuesday and thursday 1100  1230 in 107 psychology   as mentioned above lectures will often follow dewitts notes lecture attendence is strongly recommended as i will regularly present material that does not  appear in the textbook or lecture notes but will be useful for the programming assignments and exams needless to say you are responsible for all  material covered in lecture the exams will be based on the lecture material reading assignments in the notes and the course assignments electronic mail   i often use electronic mail to notify students of changes in assignments hints for programs etc i assume that you regularly read your electronic mail grading   there will be one or two evening exams during the semester a final exam and five programming assignments the exams will determine 50 of the final  grade with approximately equal weight for each one and the programming assignments will count for 10 each the c language    cs 367 will be taught using the c programming language and programming assignments must be written in c if you do not know c you should  not be in this section of cs367 jim skrentny is teaching two sections of cs367 that cover c in addition to data structures c is a large and complex  language unless you are an experience programming and even then it is a difficult language to learn from a book   there is also another www page with more information on the programming assignments gdb   there is also a web page that describes the gdb program debugger exams   exam
