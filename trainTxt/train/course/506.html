the content of that course are very similar to   that described here  contact engineering  video outreach at 12088856373 for more information      note  prior to the fall 9596 semester software engineering was offered as a   joint course combining an undergraduate  and graduate version in the same lecture section under the course   number j381j581  beginning in fall 9596 these  courses were split to better serve a diverse student population      prerequisites   cs majors certified for upper division course work   in computer science noncs majors experience in   development of moderate sized programs in a structured highlevel language    knowledge of c and pascal programming is helpful   and the ability to read and understand simple c or pascal programs is required    examples in these languages will be used to   illustrate some fundamental programming ideas        textbook   software engineering a practitioners approach   fourth  edition roger s pressman mcgrawhill 1996       class meetings   the schedule is a guide to the coverage of course material    in preparing for each class please read and study the appropriate material   in the text  there will be self evaluation and assessment forms for  you to complete on each reading assignment we will also do inclass activities  to explore or solidify concepts  discussion is an important part of this course   outside reading in trade and professional publications is also   encouraged  some articles from professional journals may be provided for  reading        other information sources   there are a number of excellent publications   that provide access to contemporary writings in   software engineering  a number of these are listed in the section   describing the term project  in addition the internet has a news   posting dedicated to discussion of general software engineering topics   compsoftwareeng and there are additional   news groups relating to special interest areas        homework   there will be about fifteen homework assignment given   in this course  normally homework assignments are due at the start of   the next class session  if you are allowed additional time for a   particular assignment it will be indicated in the instructions  if your   response to the assignment requires more than one page staple the pages   together in the upper left corner  make sure your name is on the first   page of the assignment          exams  a midterm and a final exam will be given    the exams will be given on the dates indicated in the course schedule        course overview     this course will study some of the major problem areas in software development   and will review analyze and apply many of the new techniques being used   in the development of medium to large scale software   systems  although the emphasis for their development has stemmed   from large project environments most   of the techniques can be easily adapted and applied to smaller projects   as well with the similar expectations   of improved project performance  this is not a programming project   course but we will extensively study   the software development process  major topics to be covered include      software engineering concepts amp historical perspectives   software life cycle paradigms   software requirements definition  traditional and oo   software design methodologies  traditional and oo   verification and validation   software quality   management considerations in software development      we will also cover topics of contemporary importance including   software quality assurance total quality management objectoriented   development and software process maturity      a survey textbook has been selected for use in this course but the   most up to date material can only be found in the recent technical   literature  examples include the ieee transactions on software engineering   ieee transactions on reliability ieee computer communications of the acm   acm sigsoft notices and ieee software  most of these are available at the   u of i library  selected articles may be assigned for reading and study   during the semester to supplement the text  some of them will be discussed   in course lectures      a term project on an approved topic relating to a software engineering   discipline is also required  in preparing the term projectyou will   need personal access to a reasonable technical library     grading  final course grades will be determined on the following basis      collected homework 20     midterm exam 2 20     term project  25     final exam  25     class participation 10      a numerical grading system will be employed with the final grade   based on the weighted sum of the points accumulated in each of the   above categories  final grades will be determined by a curve based   on class performance but in no case will the curve be more severe   than a standard 90 80 70 etc curve      class participation  all students are expected to make a regular contribution to the class    you should be prepared to offer your  comments regarding material presented ask interesting questions during class   and respond with good answers to questions asked in class  you may also   make contribution via email  a significant contribution about every other   week is considered a satisfactory participation level
