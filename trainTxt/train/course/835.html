watch this space for the latest updates          oct 31    the  answers to the midterm exam   and a summary of the scores are now available      a  more detailed breakdown of the grade distribution  is also available    oct 27    the specification for    project 4    is now avaiable    oct 21    the due date for project 3 has been moved to thursday oct 24      a few typographical errors in the notes on   deadlock avoidance   have been corrected  most importantly the same array  was being called d in some places and m in others  it is now called m in all places      by popular demand an  old midterm exam  is  available for you to look at  warning  you should take this example with a large grain of salt  the exam is from a very long time ago when the course  used a different text and covered topics in a different order  this semesters midterm will likely  be quite different    oct 15    the time and place for the midterm exam have been determined  it will be in room 1240 comp sci from 715 to 915 pm on october 23    oct 14    the specification for    project 3    is now avaiable    oct 9    a discussion of the issues presented  in class to day is available    oct 8    a summary of the grades for project 1 are   available    oct 6    the electronic   handin directions for  program 2 have now been posted    oct 1    the procedure givefork in algorithm 2 of the  project 2 specification  should contain a call to notify  the web page has been corrected to show this    sept 26    ive fixed two more bugs in the  project 2 specification  one minor and one that is more important      the first caused the introduction paragraph to be slightly garbled  thanks to jake dawleycarr for pointing this one out      the second was a line omitted from the sample code for algorithm i in the  programming details  section  after you create a threadscheduler you have to start it      threadscheduler sched  new threadscheduler    schedstart    this was specified correctly in the later section on the threadscheduler   but not in the details section  the web page is now fixed  thanks to liping zhang for this one    sept 20    test data files for     project 2    are now available  the directory    cs5371publicsrc    contains three data files and a java class for reading them  the file    cs5371publicsrcgraphjava    contains the definition of the class    graph    described in the project specification      the file    cs5371publicsrcpetersoncyclicgraph    contains the peterson graph shown in the project specification     as mentioned there this initial placement of forks is not  acyclic  the file    cs5371publicsrcpetersonacyclicgraph    contains the peterson graph with an acyclic initial placement of forks  the file    cs5371publicsrcstargraph    contains a star topology with one central philosopher sharing  forks with each of nine others    sept 19    todd jenner pointed out two typos in the specification for project 2     the 15 forks  are the numbers 0 through 15  should read      the 15 forks  are the numbers 0 through 14  and in eat maxthink should be replaced by maxeat      the     online version    has been corrected   thanks todd    sept 18    there was a mistake in the    java tutorial notes   in the section on strings  in the twoargument version of stringsubstring the second argument  is the offset of the end of the substring not the number of characters  in the string  the notes have been corrected  thanks to franco tung fai chan for pointing this out  sept 17      we occasionally send urgent messages directly to a mailing list  of students registered for this course  there is an   archive of all messages sent to this list on the web  if you are not receiving these messages and think you should be send  mail to solomoncswiscedu  the specification for    project 2    is now avaiable  i have received a few requests for makefiles for java  there is a sample makefile in   cs5371publicsrcmakefile  copy that file to the working directory where your java source files are  remember you should use a separate directory for each project  edit it as described in the comments in it and then type make  to compile and run your program or make classes to compile  without running    sept 13    notes on handing in your assignment and simulating   preemptive multitasking for the solaris computers  have been added here  sept 12    the     java tutorial    is now finished or about as finished as its going to get  in the section on    threads    you will find some helpful hints on how to structure   project 1      you should be aware that there is a weekly seminar on operating systems  and networking meeting mondays at 230  the first seminar of the semester is monday the 16th  check    the colloquia and seminars web page   for more details  sept 5    the java book is finally available at the  university bookstore  sept 4    the beginnings of a    java tutorial   are now available  sept 4    to use java on cs department unix workstations you must create a  file named cshrclocal in your home directory containing one  line        set pathpath sjavabin    to make the change take effect either type        source cshrclocal    or simply log out and log back in  sept 3    the specification for   project 1  is ready  sept 3  the unix orientation sessions for all new unix users are scheduled for  the following times      tues  thurs sept 3  54 pm and 6pm room 1221 cs    mon  thurs sept 9  124 pm room 1221 cs        last updated  wed sep  4 141006 cdt 1996            contents             news       summary       lecture information           text       projects       grading       course schedule           lecture notes            summary      cs 537 is intended as a general introduction to the techniques used  to implement operating systems and related kinds of systems software  among the topics covered will be  process management creation synchronization and communication  processor scheduling  deadlock prevention avoidance and recovery  mainmemory management  virtual memory management swapping paging segmentation and pagereplacement  algorithms  control of disks and other inputoutput devices  filesystem structure and implementation  and protection and security      lecture information      lecture  1100  1215 tuesday and thursday 1221 computer sciences  and statistics     discussion  1100  1150 wednesday 107 psychology        the discussion section is not optional  it is at least as important as the   lectures  the primary focus of the wednesday meetings will be topics related to the  projects  including introduction to the  java  programming language but time will also be available for answering any  questions you have regarding points raised in the the lectures or the  text     text      required     modern operating systems  by andrew s tanenbaum  prentice hall 1992     strongly recommended     the java programming language  by  ken arnold and james gosling  addison wesley 1996     online references     lots of additional helpful materials about java are available on the web      the following references have been collected locally for fast access    the java tutorial  the java language specification  java api documentation    watch this spot for additional links to the web     projects         there will be five programming projects all in the  java  programming language  sun sparcstation workstations running the solaris dialect of the unix  operating system are provided for your use but you may use any  computer to which you have access that implements the java programming  language  however if you do not use the computer sciences departments computers   you will be responsible for transferring any required  data sets or software packages to your computer      the first assignment will be an easy get acquainted exercise designed  to help you become familiar with the computing environment and the  java language  subsequent projects will involve  process synchronization  processor scheduling  disk scheduling  and filesystem implementation  on all but the first project students will be required to work in pairs  both members of a pair will receive the same grade on a project  feel free to discuss projects with anyone but    you must not share code with anyone but your partner      cheating will be vigorously punished    enough said        assignments are due at the beginning of class 11 am on the date  indicated  over the entire semester you have  three late days  of credit  you can use these late days on different assignments eg one day on each  of three assignments or all three days on one assignment  late days may not be used for the last assignment     why java       most students taking this course will be familiar with c but not java  why then did we choose java  there are several arguments in favor of it    java is a more congenial programming environment  runtime errors such as bad subscripts null pointers  and uninitialized variables cause exceptions caught by the language runtime  rather than mysterious crashes or random behavior  java strings are much easier to use than char   arrays  garbage collected storage management is extremely handy  and more  java is very trendy  java had caught on faster than any other new language in history  many of the reasons for javas growing popularity have little to do with  the way we will use it in this course we will discuss these issues in class  but a byproduct of this course  will be knowledge of java which is becoming quite a marketable commodity  java has operating system features built in  in particular it is the first widelyused programming language with  languagelevel support for concurrency threads and synchronization  monitors        on the other hand switching to a new programming language is always  a bit dislocating  fortunately there are excellent resources are available to ease the  transition  the java programming language  by arnold and gosling is amazingly good  it is neither an introductory programming primer the authors assume you  already know how to program  nor a reference manual although a  reference manual  is available online  but a readable introduction to the language which takes you all to the way  from getting started to everything you need to write quite sophisticated  programs in java  this book is available at the university bookstore  you are strongly encouraged to buy it  we have also gathered a variety of  other resources together including a nice  online tutorial  about java programming and  a reference manual  for the standard class libraries you will be using      grading        there will be a midterm and a final exam each of which will count for 25  of your grade  the midterm will be in the evening of wednesday october 23  from 715 to 915 pm in room 1240 computer sciences and statistics  the final as scheduled in the timetable will be tuesday december 17  at 505 pm  the first programming project getting started will count for 2 of your  grade  the remaining four projects will count for 12 each      course schedule        the following schedule is tentative  it may be updated later in the semester so check back here frequently        sept 3  6      introduction      chapter 1  sept 10  oct 8      processes synchronization processor scheduling
