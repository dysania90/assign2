memorial library              the instructor      gregg odampeacuten      e221 ssh 3352444 also 101c mlh   odencsuiowaedu    with the assistance of nicolae duta   dutacsuiowaedu              the course    problem solving is a pervasive human activity but some people are better at it   than others part of this difference in performance is due to differences in   knowledge of effective problem solving methods because good problem skills   are particularly important for computer programing the art and craft of   problem solving has become rather well developed within the field of   computer science the techniques that have evolved within computer science   are general ones that apply to noncomputer problem solving as well  in this class we will examine these techniques as they apply to   problems in general and in the context of being able to make computers do   what you want them to do students will get extensive experience in   performing exercises on the computer both in and out of class   these exercises will be done in a strongly supportive computing environment   no prior experience with computers is presupposed              the assignments    there will be two midterms exams each covering one section of the course as   shown on the schedule over and a final exam covering the third section plus   the course as a whole in addition there will be homework assignments every   week or so for the first half of the course and some sort of course   project during the latter half exams 1 and 2 will count 10 and 20 toward   the course grade respectively the homework will count 20 and the project   and final exam will each be 25        course grades will be determined on the basis of the resulting final   distribution of numerical scores  my current expectation is that about a   sixth of the class will get a grades that is a a or a about a   third will get b grades and another third will get c grades however i   reserve the right to adjust these proportions to better reflect overall   class performance for example if it turns out that this class does   somewhat better than expected then there will be more good grades   if it does worse then there will fewer good grades i will periodically   provide updated information about the expected distribution of grades as we   go along through the semester so you will know pretty much where you stand              the

chairman   dr joseph kearney can be made with ms zwiener in the department office   14 mlh      i will be happy to make reasonable accommodations for students with   disabilities      my office hours will be at least initially 1130 mw in 101c mlh and by   appointment in addition the ta will be available in the mlh instructional   technology center itc at times to be announced      you are expected to honor copyright laws pertaining to use of software   packages that are available to you in the information arcade the itcs and   in any other situation in this course      the schedule of courses incorrectly says that this class meets   1230mwf      makeup exams will be provided only for documented legitimate reasons   homework is to be turned in by the start of the class period on the day   it is due except that each student may have two days worth of late assignments   without penalty  thats one assignment two days late or two assignments a   day late each  any fraction of a day counts as one day saturdaysunday   count as one day      whether or not you attend class is up to you but most of the good stuff   will happen in class      this syllabus is available at      where it will be updated as the course progresses              the class
