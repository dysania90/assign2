 computer science 152 neural networks     trailer   can a computer be taught to read words aloud recognize faces perform a medical diagnosis drive a car play a game balance a pole predict physical phenomena     the answer to all these is yes  all these applications and others have been demonstrated using varieties of the computational model known as neural networks the subject of this course     the course will develop the theory of a number of neural network models participants will exercise the theory through both predeveloped computer programs and ones of their own design   course

no exams  these assignments will constitute about 50 of the grade  the other 50 of the grade is from a substantial final project involving either a working neural network application or a research paper  the grade on the project will be determined by the comprehensiveness and degree to which you explored competing approaches  the projects will be presented orally      optional voluntary oral presentations on textbook material can also be made during the term  these can act to cushion your grade  they are very much encouraged as it they really help you learn the material at a higher level
