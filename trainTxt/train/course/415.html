get through the earlier topics more quickly i will happily spend more time discussing distributed systems     the lectures are based in part on tom andersons lecture notes for cs162 at uc berkeley     textbook  andrew tanenbaum modern operating systems prentice hall 1992     project  the project is to design and implement parts of a small operating system called nachos which runs in a simulator that runs on sun workstations  you will be given a skeleton of the operating system and will be asked to implement some of the missing parts eg synchronization primitives for threads virtual memory management and a file system  you will work on the project in small teams  the programming is almost in c  a few simple features of c are used they will be explained as needed  here is a brief overview of nachos from its developers at uc berkeley    nachos is installed locally in c536nachos34 on both the burrow and the sharks     project mechanics  click above for information on accounts software tools etc   grading  the breakdown is  project  occasional problem sets 40 midterm examination 23 final examination 37  grading on the project will emphasize good design as well as working code  graduate students will be asked to implement additional features found in real operating systems undergraduates can implement these features for extra credit  the midterm will be a 75minute inclass exam  the final will be a 2hour exam held at the time specified in the registrars schedule of final examinations  the weights of the two exams are in proportion to their length  both exams will be closed book closed notes etc  the same exams will be used for 436 and 536 though separate curves will be used to convert numerical scores to letter grades     course newsgroup  acc436 will be used for both 436 and 536  if you have questions about the lectures or the project this is a good place to ask them so that other students can benefit from your questions  if you see a question and think you know the answer post it  this will help your classmates and show us that you know whats going on well reread the postings in the newsgroup when assigning grades  the instructor or the ta will periodically read the newsgroup and post answers or corrections to answers if needed         weekly announcements        week of november 18  textbook readings tanenbaum chapters 10 and 11 for this week and next     project for project 4 you can get 15 extra credit by implementing swapspace management that is efficient for sparselyused address spaces  one way to do this is the first scheme described in a recent posting about swap space      week of november 11  project here is the projects 3 and 4 faq     week of november 4  textbook readings tanenbaum chapter 9     project    1 projects 3 and 4 were distributed in last thursdays discussion section     2 here is some advice for teams that had difficulty with project 2     week of october 28  textbook readings finish tanenbaum chapters 4 and 5     final exam the final exam will be 500pm700pm on wednesday december 18 in bh 304  if you have a problem with this let me know immediately    project remember that proj 2 is due on fri nov 1   week of october 21  textbook readings tanenbaum chapters 4 and 5 for this week and next     project    1 you dont need to freeze the files from project 1 you can continue to modify them until you submit project 2  revised instructions for submitting and freezing files are in the project mechanics handout the changes are summarized in a news posting     2 revised project schedule  proj 2 due            fri nov 1 proj 3 design review  fri nov 8 and sat nov 9 proj 3 due        fri nov 15 proj 4 design review  fri nov 22 and sat nov 23 proj 4 due        fri dec 6      midterm    1 as mentioned in a news posting the answers to questions 3 and 5 have been revised since printed solutions were distributed on oct 16 so you might want to look at the revised brief solutions to the midterm     2 click for fullsize plots showing the midterm scores for 436 and midterm scores for 536  some statistics appear below  here are smaller plots         grades you can get an idea of your standing in the course from the following statistics and the above plots for the midterm    statistics for 436  itemmeanstddev project 0 out of 109213 problem set 1 out of 157247 midterm out of 9058

separate curves will be used to convert numerical scores to letter grades here are brief solutions to the midterm     project    1 design reviews for project 2 will be held on fri oct 18 1pm6pm sat oct 19 9am2pm and mon oct 21 530pm8pm  a signup sheet will be available at the midterm and during the discussion section     2 project 5 has been cancelled  project 4 will be the last project unless overwhelming popular demand prompts resurrection of project 5     week of october 7  textbook readings tanenbaum chapter 3 continued     project some comments on projects 1 and 2 have been collected in the projects 1 and 2 faq last updated oct 11     midterm    1 the midterm will cover material up to and including the lecture of oct 7  this corresponds to all of the assigned reading so far except sections 3436 of tanenbaum  the midterm focuses on the material covered in lecture and in the textbook not on nachos     2 you might want to look at these practice problems for midterm  these are intended to give you a feeling for the planned level of difficulty of the exam questions  here are brief solutions to practice problems for midterm     week of september 30  textbook readings tanenbaum chapter 3     project a signup sheet to schedule design reviews for project 1 will be available in this weeks discussion section  as per the handout the design reviews should occur on fri and sat of this week     week of september 23  textbook readings finish tanenbaum chapter 6  tanenbaum sections 2425     homework problem set 1 was distributed on sep 23  it is a problem set not a programming assignment  it must be done individually not in teams  it is technically due in lecture on mon sep 30 though i suggest you try to finish it by fri sep 27 so you can get started on project 1  some comments on problem set 1 have been collected in the problem set 1 faq     exam schedule the midterm will be inclass on wed oct 16     project    1 project 1 was distributed on sep 25  it is due by the end of the day on fri oct 11  design reviews for project 1 will be held on fri and sat oct 4 and 5 projects 1 and 2 are the same for 436 and 536     2 we strongly recommend that you carefully read both thomas nartens a road map through nachos except the parts about virtual memory and mike odonnells guide to reading the nachos source code if you havent already     3 to help you schedule your semester here are tentative due dates for future projects project 3 due sun nov 10 project 4 due sun nov 24 project 5 due sat dec 14  this has changed see below      week of september 16  temporary change in office hours on sep 16 the instructors office hour will be cancelled  a replacement office hour will be held on sep 17 11am12am     textbook readings start tanenbaum chapter 6     project project 0 is due on sep 20  the instructions in the project mechanics handout for submitting a project were flawed  a posting to acc436 describes the problem you can also read that posting here     week of september 9  textbook readings tanenbaum sections 2123 and 121     project     1 you should read a quick introduction to c by tom anderson  this was distributed in the discussion section on sep 5 if you didnt get a copy you can print one yourself or you can ask us to print one  i recommend reading it even if you are familiar with c because it contains some useful stylistic guidelines  the code for the stack example is in c536docscexample     2 a detailed version of project 0 was distributed on sep 11  it is due on sep 20  week of september 2  textbook readings tanenbaum chapter 1     project     1 try to form teams by monday sep 9 so that you can start on assignment 1 when it is distributed  as mentioned in the project mechanics handout you should notify us by email when you form a team     2 read the project mechanics page     3 start reading the a road map through nachos and the code in c536nachos34codethreads  printouts of the roadmap and the threads code will be distributed on sep 4 another very helpful resource is mike odonnells guide to reading the nachos source code  mikes guide is available only in html format so we wont be supplying printouts this doesnt mean you shouldnt read it
