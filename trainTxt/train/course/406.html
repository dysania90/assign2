to programming languages  relationships among  languages properties and features of languages and the computer  environment necessary to use languages    overview    this course provides an introduction to the foundations of programming  languages allowing a thorough understanding of programming language  semantics and critical implementation characteristics  this provides  the basis for the best choice and use of existing languages as well  as language design        interpreters and other languageprocessing  programs are used throughout to present the essential elements of  programming languages in a precise analytic manner  the extensive  use of interpreters in this course also develops skill in  metalinguistic abstraction  a powerful programming paradigm      to thoroughly understand programming languages or most any topic it is  necessary to have a variety of models or views at varying levels of  abstraction  in this course we will employ a range of models from very  highlevel almost mathematical semantics to very lowlevel almost  assembly language and emphasize the connections between levels      scheme is used as a metaprogramming language throughout the course but  this course is about fundamentals that are the basis for most programming  languages not just scheme  special attention will be given to modeling  the semantics of the java language via a series of type checkers and  interpreters      a slide presentation available in condensed form summarizes these points and others      topics include       induction recursion and scope   direct semantics interpreters   continuationpassing style   continuationsemantics interpreter   imperative form and stack architecture   static and dynamic semantics for objectoriented programming   objectoriented runtime architecture            materials       required   essentials of programming languages by friedman wand and  haynes  this text known hereafter as eopl  should be available in any of the three big textbook  bookstores tis aristotles or the iu bookstore but you may get  it cheaper if you can find a grad or undergrad student whos  taken c311 or c511 and is willing to part with it     recommended   the little schemer by friedman and felleisen  this should also be available in the bookstores and a couple copies  are on reserve in the swain hall library  the little lisper is older but similar     other     other materials may be required through the semester  these  materials will be announced in class and will be made available  through the white rabbit on indiana near kirkwood and will cost a  few dollars to cover copying costs                syllabus    read the indicated material for each week before the week begins  you are not expected to understand the material on first reading but  having read it once first you will be much better prepared for class and  discussion sections  read the material for the first two weeks in the  first week much of it should be review  more material on java will be made   available later      links in the list below are to the lecture scripts       week of september 2   reintroduction to scheme eopl preface and

functions in c as illustrated by virtualc     week of december 9   advanced java topics                  classes       attendance at discussion sections is mandatory  usually a  problem or set of problems will be given out at the beginning of  discussion section and the class will be broken up into small groups  to solve the problems  the ai leading the discussion section will go  between groups answering questions and asking questions about  the work done so far and about the class material  your answers to  these questions and your progress on the problems given in discussion  section will count toward your final grade         some lectures may also be conducted in this manner and some other  lectures will present material not found in the book  dont miss  class             assignments       for the most part assignments will be handed in by email to an  automatic checker with feedback emailed back almost immediately  assignments may be prepared on the system of your choice but should run  properly using chez scheme version 5  homework will be graded by hand  but the automatic checker will detect some errors        an assignment will usually be given each week  assignments will  be added to the list below by 500p on friday and due before 500p the next  friday late assignments will not be accepted           assignment  due  solution       1   basic scheme   f

        tools and advise    our web has information on use of  scheme at iu including emacs support  we will be using a few scheme extensions  not mentioned in eopl          points will be deducted on the homework quiz and exams if the cardinal rules of indentation are violated so  make it a habit to follow them whenever you write scheme code  this will  greatly aid your scheme programming      though emacs is a big help it is strongly suggested that you write  solutions to all exercises by hand and check them carefully for correctness  before approaching a computer  this will give you practice at indentation  by hand which is necessary for exams and more importantly it is in most  cases much easier to find mistakes in this courses exercises by thinking  about them than by debugging      the assignments dont count a whole lot toward your grade but extensive  experience has shown that students who do not make a serious effort to do  the assignments independently do poorly on exams  experience has also  shown that if most students spent much more time with paper and pencil  before approaching a computer they would spend much less time debugging  and better understand their programs  an hour with a pencil is often  worth several at the keyboard              grading       the following is a tentative schedule for evaluation with approximate  percentage contributions to
