rajeev can be arranged by appointment     mechanics    i expect that 23 of the classes will cover material from the required textbook the remainder will come from other sources ie papers other textbooks references to such sources will be given in class at the appropriate time    lectures 9001030 monday and wednesday in robert lee moore hall 5124   the newsgroup for the class is utexasclasscs380d     required textbook     distributed systems second edition s mullender editor acm press addisonwesley publishing company reading ma 1994     course content    cs380 covers abstractions that have proved useful or are expected to be useful for designing and building tomorrows distributed systems these include  global states cuts logical and vector clocks causal message delivery global property detection  message logging and checkpointing  replication management state machine approach primary backup approach  agreement protocols byzantine agreement ordered multicast  group programming techniques and applications  distributed file systems caching disconnected operations  time services byzantine clock synchronization ntp  security encryption authentication security in group programming     we will integrate the discussion of the general principles with the presentation of case studies that exemplify how such principles have been used to design and implement  real systems other topics depending on time and interest will be presented by me or by some of you the size of the class does not allow all of you to give a presentation such topics  may include  distributed shared memory  distributed objects  kernel support for distributed systems  weak consistency for replica management  protocols for electronic commerce  protocols for widearea networks   grading    there will be 4 or 5 written homework assignment solutions will be graded f b or a any solution that demonstrates a credible effort on behalf of its authors whether the solution is right or wrong will receive a b or better    collaboration on homework assignment by up to three students is permitted and encouraged but not required when there is such a collaboration a single solution should be submitted for grading with the names of the collaborators other collaborations will be considered violations of academic integrity    there will be a written takehome midterm examination for which no collaboration will be allowed    there will be no final exam each student however will be required to write a final paper about 20 pages that surveys one of the issues that we have discussed in class a list of suggested topics will be distributed in class on monday 48 the paper is due at the start of the last class wednesday 51 hence you will have 4 weeks to complete the paper    you can also team up with a colleague and prepare one or two lectures on a topic not previously covered in class if you choose this option you and your colleague will only be required to write a single survey paper of about 20 pages i warmly encourage you to consider volunteering for a presentation it will give you an excellent opportunity to improve your communication skills     problem sets    in this and all subsequent problem sets you should conform to the following general guidelines  prove and show are synonymous a precise proof is required when you are asked to prove or show something  to show that something is impossible you have to give a proof that makes it clear that the problem cannot be solved no matter what the algorithm is it is insufficient to show that a particular algorithm does not work  any algorithm that you develop must be accompanied by a proof of correctness unless you explicitly told otherwise        due mon 5 feb 1996  problem 1  the snapshot protocols discussed in class and in the textbook assume that communication channels are fifo derive a snapshot protocol for an asynchronous system that does not depend on the fifo assumption and prove it correct ie prove that the protocol produces a consistent global state you may assume that at most one snapshot is being computed at any point during a run    note the book contains a reference to a paper by mattern that contains a solution to the problem i urge you to resist the temptation to solve the problem by visiting the library    problem 2  taking the snapshot of a distributed computation is a general technique for computing stable global predicates more efficient protocols can be derived for computing specific predicates that are often conceptually simpler and more efficient in terms of the number of messages they exchange than a snapshotbased solution    in this problem you are required to derive such a specialized protocol for detecting a deadlock in an asynchronous distributed system ideally your protocol would not need a centralized monitor process and would have a message cost of on where n is the number of processes in the distributed system a monitorbased snapshot protocol for detecting deadlock has a cost of onn  the suggested solutions to these problems are now online  this link points to the postscript file    due wed 28 feb 1996 0900  this link points to the postscript file describing the second homework assignment  the final exam the assignment constituting the final exam is due by 5 pm friday may 3 1996   this link points to the postscript file describing the assignment  if you have questions feel free to send email to   lorenzo or to   rajeev        if you have ideas on improving this page please send your suggestions to     joshicsutexasedu    rajeev
