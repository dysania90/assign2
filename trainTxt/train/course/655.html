design    laboratory          prerequisite 316 signals and systems        architectural features of singlechip dsp processors will be introduced in lecture specifically the arithmetic memory organization pipelining strategies and the use of special onchip hardware eg multipliers barrel shifters will be emphasized  illustrative examples will be given  using representative dsp processors such as the   tms320c25   the  tms320c50   the atampt dsp16 the  motorola   dsp56001 the   tms320c30  the atampt dsp32 the   motorola  dsp96002 etc  laboratory experiments  using both the tms320c25 and the dsp56001 will incluse ad and da conversion  sampling realtime fir and iir digital filter implementations and a  twelveweek realtime  dsp project  of the students  choice  the laboratory will also introduce the students to the  stateoftheart equipment for dsp design and verification specifically the tektronix 2642 analyzer and the dsp technology siglabs are versatile  multidomain time and frequency instruments capable of spectrum network  and transient analysis of realtime dsp systems working in the audio  frequency range     in the remainder of this page we provide an introduction to the course and the laboratory  a copy of the introductory handout to the course and the course  syllabus can be obtained in postscript format by clicking   here       instructor      professor david j

    introductory remarks         grading    laboratory     25  lab reports    20  exam           20   final project  35            laboratory  the structured laboratory segment will count for 25 of the total grade based on participation and successful completion of the weekly exercises  each group will be asked some general questions on each  experiment  the intent is to examine the students understanding of the current experiment and if they have developed an adequate understanding of the assembly code      lab reports  a report on each experiment is required by each group of two students the lab reports will count for 15 of the total grade  these reports  should contain a title page with a brief summary an introduction a  description of the experimental setup a results section and a discussion  and conclusion section  the reports need not be lengthy and need not be  typed  however try to be complete and professional in your presentation      exams  the midterm exam will cover fundamental topics introduced in lecture and experiments  the exam will be open book notes and lab reports      final project  you will be given a list of suggested project topics by the end of the second week of class  the projects emphasize realtime dsp applications in for example speech music medical etc  the project will typically be a design of a  software or hardware algorithm for a realtime dsp system  you are encouraged to form teams of 4 to 5 students for each project with a balanced distribution of swhw design skills in addition to the dsp algorithm expertise  smaller  teams are also acceptable if the scope of the project of interest so demands or if there are difficulties in forming larger teams  each group is required to  submit a onepage  preproposal  by the end of the fourth week of class a form will be provided for filling out the preproposal  a  final project proposal  based on the instructors feedback to the preproposal will be due by the beginning of the sixth week of class  a  task timeline  should be included in the final project proposal  a onepage  progress report  is required from each group weekly after the  final project report  has been approved  you will have free access to the laboratory while you are working on your project  however you are expected to show up during the regular laboratory time to demonstrate the current status of your project to the  instructor or the ta  this will hopefully allow you to keep track of your progress towards your final goal  successful completion of the project is very important  however your effort to solve unforeseen problems and your engineering approach will be rewarded  a final project report will be due by the end of the semester and a technical presentation will be scheduled shortly afterwards    laboratory exercises        lab 1 introduction to the tms320c25 and the aib    lab 2 introduction to the dsp56001     lab 3 finite impulse response  filtering     lab 4 infinite impulse
