appointment   heddayacsbuedu mcs271 x38922       course overview      this is one of a string of advanced coursesresearch seminars held    in recent years that attempts to forge strong links between parallel    and distributed computing and between formalism and system design as an experiment we will run the course along two tracks each track    will have a concrete goal for the class participants to reach as a    group that of writing a single collective report on a major topic of    current research interest or that of implementing a small software    tool the best contributions will be selected to form the basis of one or two     publishable survey papers original research contributions or    professional magazine articles as the case may be          track 1 design problems develop notation and formalism to speak and reason precisely about    various desirable properties of distributed systems of which there    are multiple classes         safety including serializability coherence consistency    atomicity etc liveness fairness and    stability including selfstabilization       reliability availability faulttolerance    performability and dependability       scalability throughput response time    timeliness efficiency utilization    load balance and costeffectiveness       security privacy trustworthiness    and authentication       autonomy and responsiveness       usability convenience and human    complexity          the idea is to try to reach a wide and deep understanding of the    design problem of a distributed system only a subset of these properties need be covered in the group report    and one of our early tasks will be to select this subset based on    research value and interest of the participants       track 2 systems and tool survey in more breadth than depth the most important papers tools and    systems relating to file systems multimedia web internet atm    scheduling corba java parallel programming environments etc          format      the weekly two hour class meeting will generally consist of two    components each furthering progress along one of the two tracks    mentioned above  the first half of the course will consist of presentations by the    instructor the second half by students these presentations will generally follow the same format described    below the intent of this half is to bring the background of the whole class    up to a point where a shared language is possible in which research    problems can be efficiently discussed an equally important goal is to try to set forth a research agenda over     which we can focus our collective effort  there will be homeworks during this part of the course  each participant will give two 1hour presentations along each of    the two tracks one about existing work and another about project    work done for the course         by week five of semester    schedule  a date for two presentations one for track 1 and    another for track 2    email me your choice       two weeks before your presentation meet me in office hours to propose a topic    and appropriate reading material bring a url or a photocopy of    the material to the meeting       presentation strictly limited to a total of 55 minutes your presentation should    include about 10 minutes of class discussion it is your responsibility to instigate this discussion       one week after presentation    email me brief    notes in html only please covering both the presentation and the    discussion and including live links to references these will be posted on the seminars web area math symbols are best supported by writing in latex then converting to    html using latex2html       in week 8  email me a one page proposal in    plain text html or latex only please for your planned    contribution to the group report by week 10 youll have my detailed feedback       at end of course email me your section of the group    report in latex only please ill compile the report and post it on the courses web area       early in spring97 the best sections will be selected on the basis of writing quality as    well as technical strength for inclusion in a publishable paper    coauthored by the respective seminar participants this will require further work by the coauthors to polish and    integrate their contributions smoothly          credit           course credit will be based on homework in the first    half of the course and then on presentations and written    contribution to one of the two collective reports participation in    class discussions as well as on the above duties       credit in published version of group report will    depend on the level of contribution if your entire section is included in the published version then you    will be coauthor everyone else who completes the course will be acknowledged    by name in a manner commensurate with influence on the final    result          abdelsalam heddaya created
