others and share related information with the class  do not post  anonomously make a habit of looking for new notes every day      on individual or immediate matters contact your instructor or  associate instructor via email you might also want to regularly read  csstudents for postings pertinent to  students in our cs department           course content      this course is an introduction to application development in the unix  environment using the c language      we will cover the following topics         abstract data types   linear sturctures stack queues dequeues    linear allocation linked allocation    circular linking double linking header cells    classic algorithms illustrating good use of these structures    trees binary trees naturally corresponding binary trees   tree traversal preorder inorder postorder    threading of trees  inorder level order    arrays  vectors matrices sparse matricesstrings    searching    strings lists   storage management  reference counting garbage collection   searching trees  avl trees btrees   priority queues   application in the rough  how to tell the forest from the trees       a detailed course outline with  weekbyweek

and participating in group activities during lecture  in  addition there will be homework problems assigned in lecture that  will be due the following lecture  these problem sets will be short  handwritten and may not always be collected           quizzes and exams     there will two 30minute quizzes  two 50minute tests and a twohour final exam  they will be weighted roughly 50100200 for a total of 500 points  but if for instance one turns out to be inordinately difficult  i reserve the right to tune these weights  the exams are subjective written paragraphs code mostly and it is  difficult to assure that one point on the first quiz is the same  value as another point on the final exam        september 23 quiz  october 7 test  november 8 test  october 25 quiz  december 16 examination       the first quiz and the two tests are dates that professor wise  will be absent  those dates were chosen to avoid  cumulative disruption of the course  notably the first is a jewish holiday and some others as well   may be absent  of course there shall be a makeup quiz on  september 24 for any students also affected        the final exam will be held in the regular classroom  the exam is on    monday december 16 at 1015am  1215pm        grading     grades are calculated as follows       inclass tests 48       participation 4       programming assignments 48     note you must pass the final exam to pass the course      the course  gradebook will be updated regularly           programming projects     this is the most important component to the course  there will be a  programming assigment due almost every week on thursday or friday  later in the course you will be able to notice that  these are structured into two streams  and solving an early problem in the stream is necessary  to easy solutions to the later ones  do not fall behind        you will submit your source code electronically using the c343 handin program  this  handin program does not   compile  run debug or test your  code thats your job it merely saves your file in a convenient  location so your ai can grade it later        all programs must run under cxx  it is recommended that you use the  ucs machine named zinc  programs will be judged on  correctness completeness efficiency generality and aesthetics  programs that do not compile will earn zero points      program descriptions will appear below as they are assigned  in  general solutions to the programming projects will not be  supplied      programs are due by 1159 pm or 459 pm according to the system clock on the  specified date by default that there  is no grace period following this deadline  programs submitted late even just one second will not be accepted          project 0 due 95  project 1 due 912      solution  project 2 due 919       solution  project 3 due 926      solution  by thomas stuckey  project 4 due 104 and 1011      solution  by hongning wei  project 5 due 1018      solution  by rafi dowty  project 6 due 1025      solution  by konstantine ishkov  project 7 due 111      solution  by linda vinke  project 8 due 1115  project 9 due 1125  project 10 due 126              course evaluations    course evaluations will be performed electronically  at some point  you should receive an email message containing your individual  password which youll need to gain entry into the system  as the end  of the semester approaches well provide a link here into the  evaluation system          useful links         the c211 tutorial      the 343 handin program       course  gradebook

because of an unforeseen emergency  that is preceded by diligent work not for a pattern of weak performance  no student will be allowed to do extra work to raise his final  grade or to make up missing work  the last day until 4 pm to  withdraw with an automatic w is wednesday october 30 1996       programs are due on the announced date because solutions  may be discussed immediately thereafter  late assignments would  be accepted  only under the conditions similar to what could justify an incomplete  all grades become final one week after the material is returned  to you no claims however justifiable will be considered after this  deadline  if there is a foreseeable  medical or personal reason requiring you to miss a  test you must present your excuse in advance and in writing  in all  cases we require some physical proof of your claim         of course we encourage discussion and debates over the  course material but you are expected to complete all work independently  joint work  defined as pen hitting paper or fingers hitting keys  of any type is simply not permitted  similarly we encourage you to use libraries both of books  and of computer  programs but whenever  you use such archival material  you must cite  the source completely  not only is this practice good ethics but  a citation is often the most helpful and longestlived  documentation for a program        read the computer science  departments   statement on academic integrity to be sure you understand  the rules under which cs courses operate  cases of academic  dishonesty will be reported to the office of student ethics a branch  of the office of the dean of students
