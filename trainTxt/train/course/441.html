circumstances requiring you to hand something in late you should consult professor singh before the due date     programming like composition is an individual creative process individuals must reach their own understanding of the problem and discover a path to its solution during this time discussions with friends are encouraged  however when the time comes to write the code that solves the problem such discussions are no longer appropriate  the program must be your own work although you may ask teaching assistants for help in debugging  if you have a question about how to use some feature of c unix etc then you can certainly ask your friends or the teaching assistants     do not under any circumstances copy another persons program  writing code for use by another or using anothers code in any form violates the universitys academic regulations     you are responsible for insuring your files are not readable by your classmates  we recommend doing all your cs217 work in a
