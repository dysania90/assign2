recommended   read chapters 12 of the little schemer and on p 33 the first page of chapter 3 try to write rember  code for rember is on page 37  then go through 12 again trying out the code in scheme or   read chapter 2 sections 21 to 28 inclusive of the scheme programming language  again read them once and then go through them trying out the code  you can also try to write rember  gt  rember gt       write a function that takes 2 arguments an atom and a list gt       return the list with the first occurrence of the given atom gt       removed rember  remove  member gt gt   eg gt       rember
