or no mathematical background is required    however students should be prepared for a rigorous coverage of computing including extensive programming detailed studies of the internals of the computer and various advanced topics    students should be prepared to learn several mathematial notations in the course and to use them extensively          announcements    this is kind of an informal section on the web page where i eric will   try to post class gossip and info about whats going on        click for old news          anyone who scored 80 or higher on the midterm is exempt from the lab  final  however you can still take it if you wish to use it to raise your  grade  the lab final will probably be the week after thanksgiving but  thats just my best guessi havent discussed it with dr biermann  yet           the final exam for this class is on wednesday 18 december from 7 to 10   pm  heres the whole schedule          weve decided that the tf question on the quiz about rightclicking to   download an image was poorly worded if you lost half a point on this   question bring your quiz by my office in d328 or slip it under the door   and ill fix your grade  steve          its about time to be registering for classes for spring if anyone is   interested in taking more cps classes or in becoming a cps major and   would like to talk to a fellow undergrad who has taken all the classes   and is a major send me mail or   talk to me in lab or after class          grading  approximate weights    programs problems      20    programming test aka lab final in labs      10    quizzes every week after wednesday lecture      25    midterm exam wednesday 16 october      20    final exam as indicated on official schedule      25         policies  each student must write his or her own programs without help from other persons  after a program is typed into a machine students may help each other to find bugs but not to write new code    homework problems must be done without help from others      no makeup exams will be given  if an exam is missed for reasons beyond the students control a written excuse should be handed in  the final grade will be based on the other scores earned      the lowest two quizzes will not be counted  no makeup quizzes will be given  if a quiz is missed for an excusable reason be sure to hand in a written excuse  the quiz average will be based on the quizzes actually taken      late homeworks programs or labs will receive 80 of full credit if they are handed in within seven days o the regular due date  after seven days no credit will be given except in unusual circumstances      the grade of i incomplete will be administered as specified by university rules  thus it will be not given to those students who simply did not complete the course on time      unethical practices by any student such as copying on an exam or homework will be dealt with strictly usually by turning the case over to the judicial board   special caution often two or more versions of the quizzes or exams are given on a given day  thus your neighbor may be taking a different test from you      the final exam is not optional and every student will be required to take it at the scheduled time unless a written excuse from the dean is presented      students who receive 85 or higher on the midterm exam may skip the lab final programming test  their final grades will be based upon their average in other parts of the course      final grades will be assigned approximately on the basis of 90100 a 8089 b and so forth         schedule  this schedule will be projected to the end of the term soon  if you click on the topic for a day you will see a handout for that day  note that the handout for 94 is this document clicking
