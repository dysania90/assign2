contacting any of the instructors or ais  course description  programming is in general the art of solving problems  the study of computer programming is therefore the study of solving problems with a computer but it is also much more  when a programmer writes a program he or she is actually constructing a model of a process for doing somethingsuch a model is called an algorithm furthermore the programmer is concerned not only with whether the program simply works but also with how well it works and how it interacts with both users and other programs    this class is designed mainly to teach you the art of computer programming  to that end we shall try to develop in you a sense of style and aesthetics that will help guide your programming efforts and we shall try to develop your intuition about how things work and why  you will learn some of the design principles that go into the engineering of good programs  we shall teach you a little computer science to give you a way of analyzing your programs and your algorithms and finding the means to improve them  you will learn a number of standard algorithms and some programming  idiomsstandard ways of performing certain kinds of tasks    to do any programming we need to choose a language  whichever we choose the language does not place limits on what our programs can do but only on what they look like  it provides us with a framework in which to organize our ideas about processes and problem solving  the programming language we use in this class is scheme  we have chosen it because it provides a convenient mechanism for describing most of the idioms and processes that programmers have found useful  we wont spend much time teaching the details of the language because we dont have to you will find that it is easy to pick up as we go along    it is often helpful to first program using a simple powerful language like scheme even if one must then translate the solution into a more traditional programming language like c  the simplicity of scheme allows us to treat many computer science topics in more depth than would be possible if c or c were used for in traditional languages more inessential detail must be mastered  scheme allows us to give a better impression of the true joys and challenges of programming then you will be in a better position to study c in your next computer science course c212    finally computer programming is still a fairly young field and it hasnt lost its sense of fun for lots of people including us  we hope that you will enjoy it as much as we do    goals  at the end of the course a student can be expected to know the following concepts and to be able to write good scheme programs    the students should be able to use the following data types symbols numbers booleans lists vectors and matrices strings and characters  the students should know how to write programs in recursive iterative and imperative styles    students should be able to write recursive programs on lists both those containing only top level items and those containing nested sublists tree recursion  the students should be able to use procedures as firstclass objects that is pass them as arguments and also write programs whose values are procedures  this includes the currying and composing of procedures   the students should understand the concept of scope and environment  they should be able to use locallydefined procedures  students should be able to use abstraction both with data in making programs independent of the data representation and also with procedures in abstracting the structure of programs  students should be able to use the input and output routines and write convenient user interfaces for their programs  students should be able to handle the binary representation of numbers  students should know some of the standard sorting routines eg insertion sort on2 mergesort and quicksort on log n and understand the advantages and disadvantages of each  they should also be able to write both linear and binary search programs  students should know how to mutate various data structures including lists vectors strings  in addition they should understand sideeffecting variables  students should be able to read programs and have an appreciation of what constitutes good programming style  they should be aware of the relative efficiency of programs  certain topics will be included if time permits  these include such things as writing and using syntactic extensions developing an objectoriented programming package in scheme and using streams   literate programming  every programmer knows that programs must be comprehensible to the computer  the programming language implementation complains when they are not but with some practice it is generally easy to solve such problems    what is less appreciated is that programs must also be comprehensible to the programmer  otherwise the programmer cannot have any confidence that the program is correct  a program may easily be comprehensible to the computer but not do what is intendedand only the programmer knows what is intended  in most cases it is also essential that programs be comprehensible to other programmers  though this is not typical of student programming experience in the real world programmers spend most of their time modifying huge programs that were developed over a long period of time by many other programmers  modifying someone elses code or even your own a few months later may be a joy or a nightmaredepending on how clearly the program is written    thus we emphasize the importance literate programming writting programs that are easy to understand relative to the difficulty of the problem they solve  literate programming is almost always more important than other programming goals such as efficiency and code compactness though efficiency and compactness are often byproducts of literate programming  course materials     required   g springer and d friedman scheme and the art of programming mit pressmcgraw hill 1989  we will cover most of the first threequarters of this text  the source code is available  c211 course packet available at the white rabbit 110 s indiana ave  this packet contains a tutorial on the software systems the course uses and the first assignment    recommended   d p friedman and m felleisen the little schemer fourth edition mit press 1996  this little book is the best introduction to recursive programming that we know of and is designed for self study  recursion is used throughout this course but some students require extra material before they feel comfortable using it if you are having any difficulty mastering recursion we strongly recommend that you get this book and study it on your own   interpreters for macs and pcs     there is a fairly beautiful scheme package available for macintosh and a less beautiful one for dos        syllabus and lecture scripts  most of the first threequarters of the text scheme and the art of programming will be covered  approximately one week will be devoted to each of the chapters listed below    the links in the following list are to script files that drive the online lecture presentations  the script file for chapter n may also be accessed on the machine copper as the file  c211wwwscriptn    prof leone uses a separate script for each lecture based on the scripts below sometimes with more examples    chapter 1 data and operators         emacs keybindings     chapter 2 procedures and recursion chapter 3 data abstraction and numbers chapter 4 data driven recursion  chapter 5 locally defined procedures               polyalgss           polyrep1ss           polyrep2ss           binary notation           chapter 6 interactive programming  chapter 7 abstracting procedures  chapter 9 using vectors  chapter 10 sorting and searching  chapter 11 mutation  chapter 12 objectoriented programming   assignments  a programming assignment will be due almost every week  the assignments will appear below as they are assigned  assignment n is also available as plain text in the file c211wwwanf96txt links to answer files with names of the form c211wwwansnf96ss will be

university computing services machines named copper and zinc  new students should have a network id and instructions for creating copper and zinc accounts      as soon as you have your account you should configure it to run emacs scheme within emacs and the handin program  this is done by entering c211setup hitting return and logging out  you only have to do this once  when you login the next time your account will be configured for c211  you have to configure both your copper and zinc accounts       assignments will be posted on or before wednesday afternoon and will be due electronically by 500 pm on the wednesday of the following week  any written material will be due at the beginning of the lecture on that thursday or friday  late assignments will not be accepted  in computing the semester assignment average the lowest assignment grade will be dropped  although assignments count for only 10 of the final grade it is essential that you do the assignments to master the material  computer programming like playing a musical instrument can only be mastered through lots of practice    programming assignments are submitted using the program c211handin in the directory c211bin on copper and zinc  the handin program evaluates and grades your programs behavior and the results are returned to you almost immediately via email  since zinc allows email to be sent but not received you will have to read the grading results on the machine where you normally read your mail  you may correct and resubmit your programs as many as five times until the announced deadline  the highest grade recorded for the assignment will be the one that is entered into the class gradebook     in this course you may discuss assignments with other students  do not assume this is true in all your courses  we expect you to actually think through and fully understand assignment solutions  we have found that students who copy someone elses work and turn in something they do not fully understand usually fail the examinations and the 10 added by having good assignment grades is insufficient to pass the course  teamwork in doing assignments is good as long as each member of the team contributes and fully understands the programs  this certainly means that you should not put your name on a file written by someone else and submit it as your own work     after the final submission of an assignment it will not only be electronically graded but an associate instructor will also grade the assignment for style  good programming style makes it easier to get your programs working and also develops the habit of literate programming which as we have already noted is of great importance in developing large programs  in this course good style is also rewarded in the evaluation of exams  for scheme programming consistent use of a suitable style of program indentation is essential and violation of the first cardinal rule of indentation will automaticaly result in loss of credit    communication  the course newsgroups   accscic211 and accscih211 will be used to post announcements such as assignments exams and any exceptions to our usual office hours  you are also encouraged to use it to post questions related to the course or share related information with the class  make a habit of looking for new notes a few times each week on individual or personal matters please feel free to contact your instructor or associate instructor via email     another newsgroup you should check regularly is csstudents which contains important announcements from the computer science department to all of its students  it also contains interesting dialogs on various topics    this course description is accessible as an html hypertext markup language file on the www world wide web
