144      student scores and grades       homework assignments  homework 0 image enhancement by histogram modification optional  make a copy of your portrait image in cs7661publicimages and then use xv to contrast enhance your face  do this by first rotating the image then cropping a window around your head say down to your shoulders and finally interactively adjusting the intensity modification function in the color editor window under the windows button  you are also free to modify other things such as color if you wish  when you have found a good grayscale transformation save the result as a color gif image and put it in the same directory where the original image is  send me email telling me qualitatively what intensity transformation you applied and why it improves the quality of the image overall  ill then use this image in the photo board of students in the class  feel free to use this image in your own web home page as well    homework 1 skeletons due october 3        learn about getting started with     the vista vision software     read the introduction to vista programming manual     that is available at doit documentation     corrections to the original assignment         in method 1 change condition 1 to be at least 3   instead of at least 2   this will prevent some  types of shapes from disappearing altogether  in method 1 condition 2 should also count as a 01 transition  the case where nw0 and n1  in method 2 the 3 x 3 matrix c for cityblock distance should have  infinity ie some large constant not 0 in the four corners  in method 2 the 3 x 3 matrix c for chessboard distance should have  0 not 1 in the center position            test images to be used     1 pvisionimageshw1doitv     2 pvisionimageshw1handv     to evaluate your thinning results you might want to     try the following additional experiment using the output of at least     one of your tests  1 convert your skeleton image to ubyte format using     vconvert 2 edit you may need to use emacs because vi is     not 8bit clean the header of the new     image file so that it contains the following lines right after the     repn ubyte line  componentinterp gradient  lowthreshold 1  highthreshold 2     3 run vlink on this file and then 4 vsegedges       try using the results on the image handv for example to     see how well this approach might be used to determine the direction     the index finger is pointing for a hci application say     note  the thinning method may in fact delete entirely some shapes     eg a 2 x 2 block of 1s surrounded by all 0s will disappear     the thinning algorithm is based on the papers 1 t zhang and c suen     a fast parallel algorithm for thinning digital patterns     comm acm 273 1984 236239 and     2 h lu and p wang a comment on a fast

space quota     of 50mb so you can store images for homeworks and     your project  be sure to delete old images and compress others     see gzip1 however     in order to save space       email      email sent to cs7661list     goes to everyone in the class including the instructor and ta     printers      to print images you should use one of the laserprinters     laser1  laser4 which are located     in room 1359  alternatively the generic printer name laser will     send output to one of the four printers with the shortest queue  caution     before sending images to the printer be sure to check the queue  if     there are a lot of jobs being printed it is bad manners to send images     to be printed because they take so long to print  be considerate     vision software
