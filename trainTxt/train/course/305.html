1 to provide an opportunity to write about and discuss matters that will have a  significant impact on your future professional life      2 to build your confidence in your ability to converse with people concerning technical issues and ethics in the information systems environment     3 to demonstrate your ability to analyze and write about and discuss the issues and problems facing your chosen profession      4 develop and justify your own personal professional code of ethics      5 to become sensitive to keeping abreast of major new developments in information systems and in broadening your perception of your field     seminar activities     1  all reading assignments should be completed before the class period in which the assignment is to be discussed  this will be a prudent practice since a major part of your grade will be based on participation in seminar discussions  i have no preconceived grade distribution  it is possible for everyone in the class to get an a grade  the process for doing well is spelled out here in detail  i only care that there is a fair effort given for what ever grade is received  fair effort means that in a 3 credit hour course meeting 2 times a week one should expect to put in at least three hours of preparation for each meeting period in order to do well  since much of the preparation is reading the time required will be more for those without rapid reading skills     2  write a discovery paper about one page in length covering each reading assignment  these papers will indicate what you discovered in the reading assignment or within your self as illuminated by the reading assignment  it is not intended this be a mere summarization of the articles but a thoughtful analysis of ideas you select  be sure to list the number of your paper using the period s in the day of the week column in the class schedule  these papers will be handed in at each seminar in your format for the paper make a place for your discussion score in the upper right corner  papers need to be machine printed hardcopy and free of spelling and obvious grammatical errors  you will be given feedback on the quality of your writing  timely submission is the major criterion for the discovery paper grade  if turned in at the discussion period when due they will receive 3 points for a quality paper  papers lacking in qualitylacking thoughtful analysis spelling or obvious grammatical errors will receive 2 points  if you must miss a seminar you may receive a negotiated level of credit for the paper if advanced arrangements are negotiated with me  if no advanced arrangements are made the late paper will only receive 1 point  of course no paper no points     3 come to seminar prepared to discuss your discovery paper andor the reading assignment  regular seminar meeting times will be used to discuss concepts and insights from your discovery papers for each days reading assignment   the major variable in the determination of grade in this seminar will be the score you assign yourself for your participation in the discussion  participation in the discussions will be self graded each day and the score for the days discussion will be handed in each period  according to the following scale  0 reading assignment not competed  did not participate in discussion 1 reading assignment not competed but participated in the discussion 2 reading assignment completed but little or no contribution to the discussion 3 reading assignment completed and a significant contribution to the discussion that relates to the reading assignment  a 3 discussion score may not be taken for any class at which you arrive late or leave early  from this grade scale you can see that your grade is heavily impacted by whether you have read the reading assignment each day  you may be called upon to justify your score if it varies widely from my observation of your participation  this will be accomplished by my changing your score on your paper and initialing it  when you receive the paper back if you think i have been unfair or overlooked your contribution see me during office hours to resolve the difference      4 one major writing assignment will be required  the major writing assignment which is a report of the development and justification of your own personal professional code of ethics after the pattern of the acm code of ethics  ive not seen a good job done on this paper in less than about ten pages and being a personal code it should be written mainly in the first person  this paper may be handed in for a preliminary grade on or any time prior to period  20  it will be graded with feedback and returned as soon as possible  it can then be resubmitted for an improved grade based on changes needed  the deadline for this assignment is period  25  the turning in of papers for preliminary grade is optional     5 writing three summary papers is required as shown in the schedule  these summary papers will address a set of questions that will relate to approximately the prior one third of the reading assignments     student evaluation      1 discovery papers                 25         keep track of your 2 discussion scores                50         scores for both  3 three summary papers  ea 5     15         your daily papers amp 4 major writing assignment         10         discussion scores

better than the 00 which you will receive for the discussion paper and discussion score if you miss the discussion and dont hand in the discussion paper       2  the late penalty for either summary papers or the code of ethics paper will be 20 for each day late      3  university standards will be upheld in this class  this includes being honest adhering to the byu dress standards and following all other standards you have agreed to uphold  you must do your own work especially on writing assignments  be particularly sensitive to the implicit copyright under the bern convention of each c s 404 paper done in previous semesters  i have copies of many of these papers and plagiarism would be grounds for failing this course       4 an education at a university requires complying with many rules and regulations  however as much as possible i want to encourage new ways of doing things  initiative and creative thinking are encouraged  i hope you will enjoy learning many new concepts and practical details  i especially hope that in the process you learn that through being good your capacity to do well increases                                  grade breakdown for c s 404
