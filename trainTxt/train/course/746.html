selected sections many of the readings for the course will be online but the first set of readings is part of my recent book on lisp and artificial intelligence there will be several readings from the book throughout the course including readings on lisp logic programming and prolog grammars and parsing language understanding systems and shells for expert systems you can either purchase the whole book at the bookstore approximately 15 copies have been ordered or do a combination of getting copies from the copy center and reading in the library  the book is entitled the elements of artificial intelligence using common lisp 2nd edition w h freeman 1995  chapter 2 introduction to programming in common lisp and the lisp glossary may be purchased separately at the copy center in the basement of the communications building     online reference materials for lisp  what lisp is   the lisp faq provides the answers to many questions about lisp and its implementations   common lisp the language 2nd edition is the standard reference on common lisp it seems best if you access it via the tableofcontents page rather than by trying to download the entire html file or postscript   you can get the source code for  the lisp programs from the elements of artificial intelligence using common lisp 2nd edition  the web site for digitool inc the company that maintains and supports macintosh common lisp provides the most current information about mcl  here are some interesting links to info about how to use lisp for  programming worldwide web applications     online reference materials for c  introduction to c programming is an online tutorial  programming in c is another online tutorial but its on a website in the uk that doesnt always respond promptly  these are two of the several tutorials that are listed  here   online reference materials for java   the java language trail map    announcements    january 2  welcome to this course and its course web this course is about programming languages and their implementation in some of the departments listings it is called languages and compilers although in the catalog it is called programming languages and their implementation it covers interpreters compilers and other techniques for building programming systems  our attention will focus mainly on two particular programming languages lisp and c  with lisp we will explore many issues relevant to intepreted languages while with c we will investigate compilers in addition to traditional language issues and techniques we will also look into current issues such as visual programming systems and programming facilities for the worldwide web   january 2  facilities this quarter cse 413 students will have the use of both the mscc macintoshes running macintosh common lisp 30 and the mscc unix systems mscc is the mathematical sciences computing center  the mscc macs are located in the basement of thompson hall  some of the macs are in room 3 and some in room 9 while the macs offer mcl and a variety of other languages such as mathematica the mscc unix hosts offer c lex yacc allegro common lisp and other software facilities    macintosh common lisp provides a particularly powerful environment including full implementation of the common lisp standard integrated editor called fred and extensive facilities for graphics and user interface construction   the macintosh computers are networked and files can easily be transferred between them and the unix host machines of mscc       students who have difficulty getting to the macintoshes in thompson hall can supplement their macintosh work with work on their own pcs using such packages as xlispstat for windows and microemacs however due to our limited ability to support alternative facilities students who wish to work on their own pcs will need to access these resources themselves from archives on the internet  also note that xlispstat is a barebones implementation of common lisp and does not have the extensive programdevelopment support that mcl has while we are fortunate to have the powerful mcl system for this course there is one disadvantage of using ityou must use it in the mscc lab unless you purchase your own copy of it from digitool inc mcl normally costs about 500 a copy but there is a special student deal allowing students to purchase it for 135 it has been pointed out that there is a free version of allegro common lisp for windows which can be downloaded from franzcom on the web this may be an attractive tool for some students    final examination  the final exam for cse 413 will be given on monday march 11 in sieg 325 from 1030 to 1220  it will be a closedbook test   january 4  note this on thursday january 4 we will meet in thompson hall room 3 so
