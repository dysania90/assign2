is a tight bound   give a tight bound on the competitiveness of lru for the        caching problem assuming that your cache can hold at most       k pages here youre counting the number of cache        misses   read 153 do 1535    read 22 do 222   a few fun problems     due monday february 26th        solutions here             problem set 4     a skip list is constructed as follows   every element has a pointer at level 0 which connects   all of them into a sorted linked list  for each i gt 0 some subset of the elements at level i1  have level i pointers which connect them into a   sorted linked list      the structure is constructed as follows suppose youre  given such a list to insert the next element x into the  list search for where it goes in the level 0 list and   splice it in then      i  1    while flip  tails        add x to the list at level i       i        sketch a proof that  1 the resulting list has height olg n with  high probability assuming that the probability of heads  is p 0 amplt p amplt 1 and   2 inserting or finding an element in a data structure  constructed in this way requires olg n time       suppose that you have access to a biased coin with  unknown bias althogh probability of heads is strictly  between 0 and 1 show how to use this coin to simulate   a fair coin       suppose that i give you a piece of paper with n  lines drawn across its surface theyre arbitrarily  oriented and each goes from edge to edge theres  a dot drawn somewhere on the paper representing the  origin you repeat the following choose one of the   remaining lines at random and cut the paper along it  then hold onto the piece that has the dot origin and  throw the rest away repeat this until all lines have  been cut so youre left with the smallest convex  region containing the origin that is bounded by the  given line segments      fact throughout this process the total number of  times that you cut across any of the remaining lines is expected to be  on ln n       use this fact to design an algorithm which given n  halfplanes each containing the origin computes their   intersection in expected time on lg n by incrementally  adding one halfplane at a time        recall the description of treaps given in class   briefly every element has a key and a priority   they are put into a binary tree such that they have  an inorder ordering binary search tree property with  respect to keys and a heap ordering with respect to  priorities  a random treap is one where the priorities have been  assigned randomly for this problem well just assume  that the prioirities are given by some random permutation         let x be any element and a the set of ancestors of  x in the random treap let x be the length of the path  from the root to x then       x   keys lt x and in a        keys gt x and in a       use this obvious fact to give a precise value for the expected   depth of x when x is the mth largest element in the  tree ie solve for the leading constants as well  you can tack on a o1 at the end if youd like      recall that to insert an element you proceed  as in a binary search tree then attach a random  priority and rotate up the tree until heapordering  has been restored      argue that the expected number of rotations on an   insertion is 2        deletion in a treap is handled in a rather odd  way to delete x rotate it down the tree until it  is a leaf and remove it       describe this procedure in more detail then show  that the expected number of rotations is 2            due monday march 18th     solutions here
