of 111 cummington st  required textbook   introduction to the theory of computation preliminary edition michael sipser pws publishing company 1996 see  for an uptodate list of errors in the book   one copy of this book will be on reserve at the science and engineering library after 91096 ill put another copy on reserve if i can find one   you will read most of the textbook in this course other useful books  elements of the theory of computation lewis amp papadimitriou prentice hall 1981  introduction to automata theory languages and computation hopcroft amp ullman addisonwesley 1979   prerequisites   to enroll in this course you must have satisified the following course requirements if you havent done so but still want to remain in the course please see me   ma 293 discrete mathematics 1  cs 112 or cs 113 programming amp data structures in c   topics   this course is a core requirement in undergraduate computer science curriculums at most colleges its purpose is threefold first to encourage you to investigate the nature of computation second to further develop your formal reasoning and writing skills and third to add new techniques to your programming bag of tricks    accordingly we will develop several formal models of computation each more powerful than the last at each stage we will prove some of what our intuition suggests and sometimes what it denies about these models we will also see how most models admit two very different characterizations one of machines that are able to recognize certain events and another of grammars that are able to generate exactly what these machines recognize    in particular we will study regular languages regular expressions finite deterministic and nondeterministic automata contextfree grammars pushdown automata turing machines  and more if time allows     grading   the following breakdown is tentative but reasonably representative of how grades will be computed i mentioned an optional project but i havent decided how to fit that into the scheme yet  6 homeworks    60 midterm        20     thursday 1024 1230150pm final          20     tuesday 1217 1230230 pm    note that each test is worth 2 homeworks the tests will be much simpler than the homeworks  homework assignments   when writing up your homework there are two goals you must keep in mind first to give evidence that you have put real thought into the problem and second to convince the reader that your solution is correct and that you know why as a programmer you have some experience with this sort of writing an effective program must be written for both a compiler and a human reader similarly solutions to your problems must be correct in the sense of solving the stated problem but they must also be comprehensible to the grader    as with any writing the first draft of a problem solution is usually unpresentable all of the pieces may be there but they tend to be chaotically assembled the single most important thing you can do to make your solutions presentable is to rewrite them after you have discovered why they are correct and then to throw away or at least tuck away your initial draft remember scratch paper is cheap    be careful to realize that this emphasis on presentation has nothing to do with whether english is your native language or whether you prefer to write your solutions with pencil pen quill or word processor a wellwritten solution starts by stating assumptions and then works towards a clearly defined goal emphasizing the overall direction and omitting the superfluous     late policy   in general you will have at least one week to work on a homework assignment and three opportunities to attend my office hours before that assignment is due    assignments turned in during one of the two class periods following the due date will be graded at 60 of their face value assignments turned in later than that will receive no credit but well still grade them for feedback purposes collaboration and plagiarism  collaborate klabrat labrashn labrativ     ratr vi ll collaboratus pp of collaborare to labor together fr     l com  laborare to labor 1 to work jointly with others esp in an     intellectual endeavor 2 to cooperate with or assist usu willingly an     enemy of ones country and esp an occupying force 3 to cooperate with an     agency or instrumentality with which one is not immediately connected      collaboration n    collaboration is encouraged primarily in the first and third senses when working on homework problems and preparing for exams none of the problems in this class are intended to have secret solutions the more resourceful you are at discovering solutions the more time you will have to write them well indeed if you are stuck on a problem i will be happy to talk with you about it during office hours however the solutions you turn in must be your original writing copying a prepared solution is not collaboration at all it is plagiarism      plagiarize plajriz also je vt  to steal and pass off as     ones own the ideas or words of another to present as ones own an idea     or product derived from an existing source  plagiarizer n    plagiarizing anothers words is not tolerated at boston university it is so disdained that there are specific procedures for accusing and punishing those who plagiarize do not copy another persons work and present it as your own    the above definitions were copied from the webster server at bu     attendance   attendance is not an official part of the course grade but it is your responsibility to stay informed some announcements will be made only in class and obviously its easier to learn things from a teacher than directly from the book unless you hate the teacher    mailing list   other announcements will be made only by email to add yourself to the course mailing list log on to a cs cluster computer such as csa and type          csmail a cs305        the atanasoffberry computer abc
