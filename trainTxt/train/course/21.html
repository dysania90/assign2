the course  there will be a project due every week  most projects will entail writing several small programs    you will submit your source code electronically using the s212 handin program  this handin program does not compile run debug or test your code thats your job it merely saves your file in a convenient location so your ai can grade it later  submit ascii source code files only  never submit object or executable code please  you may submit a program as many times as you want up to the deadline only your last submission will be graded    all programs must run under g  it is recommended that you use the ucs machine named copper  programs will be judged on correctness completeness efficiency generality and aesthetics programs that do not compile will earn zero points    project descriptions will appear below as they are assigned  in general solutions to the programming projects will not be supplied    projects are due by 1159 pm according to the system clock on the specified date there is no grace period following this deadline programs submitted late even just one second will not be accepted    project 1 due 111  and solutions project 2 due 118         and solutions project 3 due 125         and solutions project 4 due 21         and solutions project 5 due 28         and solutions project 6 due 215         and solutions project 7 due 222         and solutions project 8 due 229         and solutions project 9 due 37 project 10 due 327 project 11 due 44 project 12 due 411 project 13 due 418        course evaluations  course evaluations will be

number representations   floating point representations   general programming tips from jeremy including information on gdb coding tips and coming soon makefiles   iu address book   the acm homepage      miscellaneous      incompletes are given only because of an unforeseen emergency that is preceded by diligent work not for a pattern of weak performance no student will be allowed to do extra work to raise his final grade or to make up missing work  the last day until 4 pm to withdraw with an automatic w is wednesday march 6 1996     programs are due on the announced date because solutions may be discussed immediately thereafter  late assignments would be accepted only under the conditions similar to what could justify an incomplete all grades become final one week after the material is

in writing  in all cases we require some physical proof of your claim       you are expected to complete all work independently  joint work of any type is simply not permitted  read the computer science departments  statement on academic integrity to be sure you understand the rules under which cs courses operate  cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the office of student ethics a
