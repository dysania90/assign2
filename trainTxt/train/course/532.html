print postscript from a mac in any itc  the method requires  that you print on the laser printer which means you need to have  a laser punchcard the postscript wont print on an imagewriter  these are the steps     make sure the laser printer is selected by using chooser under  the apple menu   use netscape to download the postscript file to a local disk   open tcp connect ii under the file menu   there is a command called print postscript file under the file  menu of tcp connect  open this function find the file you had   previously saved and open it     4 sep reading guide updated   3 sep additional lecture notes for 5 and 12 sep posted   3 sep postscript viewers no guarantee for the     following pointers  i gathered some files from archives on  the internet but i have not tried these myself  notice that  these are rather large files so dont try to download via   modem perhaps in an itc you can download them     for a pc the following combination of files gives  you ghostscript and ghostview ghostscript is necessary  for ghostview      gs260fntzip 1760k     gs261exezip 1192k     gs26wi3bzip 58k     gsview10zip 175k      for win95 the following viewer claims to display  using truetype but im not sure it would handle the   figures and equations in the lecture notes      rops3244zip 382k      for macs we have      macgsv1068ksithqx 2961k     use this one for 680x0 macs or power pc macs     macgsv10ppcsithqx 2983k    this one is for power pc macs only       29 aug how to save a postscript file and bypass  ghostview under netscape  instead of pressing the left  button on the link press the right button on your mouse   that will give you an option to save link as  then save the file in source format  after you save it maybe you can use some other tool  to print or view it   28 aug reading for chapter 1   28 aug first homework posted due 5 september           ted herman    thu 14 nov 1996
