   cis 625           parallel programming             spring 1996        whats new on these web pages     ive added the description of the  generic formal package parameter workaround to the ada95 web  page  the sources are also in my ftp directory   ive added the ada source to my ftp directory  commonftppubcisdwyercis625ada  there is a loose  organization in particular the replicated worker stuff is in  replicated   ive added a page related to the midterm and final exams  it lists problems that you should be able to work   ive added a page about the ada95 compiler see below                overview      fundamental advances in computing performance are dependent on  adapting programming techniques to new parallel computer architectures  whether it is to meet realtime  constraints to improve response times for computationally intensive tasks  or to model physicallyparallel systems  parallel programming techniques should be useful  to students and professionals in a wide variety of  disciplines advanced undergraduates in cis  graduate students in  computing systems  engineers building embedded systems and scientists doing  theoretical calculations could benefit from this course   the goal of this course is to build on the  knowledge of data structures and algorithms from cis 500  to expose the student to fundamental concepts in concurrent and  distributed programming

exams          lectures  amp readings    the bulk of the concepts in the course will  be presented explained and illustrated by way of extended  examples in the lectures  the readings serve to provide more  details and depth on selected concepts      lectures and readings function  as an integrated presentation of the course material    it is expected that you will have completed each reading prior to the  appropriate lecture  take advantage of class time to ask  questions and elaborate on issues that were presented in the  readings        homeworks  there will be 4 programming     projects  you will be working with three different languages  multipascal concurrent c and     ada95  the programming  projects are designed to provide indepth exposure to   the concepts covered in the course  the use of different  languages will help to illustrate the variety of different   solution strategies that are possible      there are no group projects in this class so   all students are expected to do their own work you may discuss the  projects with other students but you may not share designs code data  modules objects documentation specification requirements or  interfaces please refer to the ksu  campus phone book which contains the student life handbook  you are governed by these guidelines and procedures take  note of the following passage  an  instructor who is convinced that he or she has evidence of plagiarism or  cheating should first decide on the appropriate punishment the instructor  may impose punishment ranging from no credit for the work or exam to an f in  the class the instructor may recommend dismissal or suspension but that  recommendation can only be carried out by the undergraduate grievance  board at a minimum no credit will be given for the work or exam in which  dishonesty occurred the instructor may draft a memo for the students  record to be kept in the provosts office until graduation indicating the  nature of the dishonest act            examinations    there will be a 1hour inclass midterm exam  and a 2hour inclass comprehensive final exam             final grades will be assigned based on the following weighting  homeworks 50 midterm 15 and final 35            readings      the required readings for this course include a text book  and selected papers from the literature  these papers are  available in the holdings of the

  include assignments solutions lecture notes and links  to other parallel programming pages          organization amp schedule      the course is broken up into two phases  in the first phase  we will be covering material in the lester text  this  will provide you with a solid background on the fundamentals  of parallel programming  in the second phase we will cover  a number of additional topics related to parallel programming  that will build off this foundation  professor wallentine  will lecture during the first phase of the course and  professor dwyer will lecture during the second phase  professor  dwyer will hold the office hours for the course      the course will cover the following topics  motivation for parallel programming    why parallelism  when should we use it    disjoint parallel processes  how do we break a problem  up into subproblems that can be solved independetly  basic  concepts  shared memory systems    multiprocessor architectures process communication and  synchronization  synchronous parallelism    distributed memory systems  communication and system  topologies  asynchronous parallelism    system performance  amdahls law
