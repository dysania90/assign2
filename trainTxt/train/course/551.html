and formal methods   fall 1996    meeting times mw 9051020  lgrc a339      instructor neil immerman       aim of the course we will provide introductions to propositional  predicate and modal logics  these will be studied and used throughout the  course as tools for the specification and verification of properties of  programs and protocols        topics      firstorder logic propositional logic predicate logic  completeness and compactness theorems semantics via quantifier games  g dels incompleteness theorem    modal logic temporal logic and logics of knowledge axiomitization  semantics via kripke structures    applications these may change slightly according to the background and  interests of the students       evolving algebras due to gurevich et al this offers an operatonal  semantics for programming languages and protocols via finite logical  structures    temporal logic of actions lamports system of specification and  verification via temporal logic     distributed protocols we will use logics of knowledge to express  correctness and security of distributed protocols     model checking using temporal logic to verify properties of systems     symbolic model checking using ordered binary decision diagrams obdds  to symbolically represent and modelcheck huge kripke structures         requirements students will be expected to participate in class  there will be three problem sets concerning the introductory material on  firstorder and modal logic  each student will choose a more advanced  topic to study in detail  he or she will write a short paper and give a  lecture on this topic      texts for firstorder logic we will follow logic and  structure third edition by dirk van dalen springerverlag  this is  available at the jeffery amherst college store in downtown amherst  for the rest of the course we will follow selected research papers      prerequisites sufficient mathematical sophistication  if you are  unsure whether you have it try looking at van dalen andor come  talk with me      notes and handouts       notes  sept 4 1996     notes  sept 9 1996     notes  sept 11 1996 plus first problem set due 92596     we have finished propositional logic and begun predicate logic  see  notes  sept 16 1996     on wednesday oct 2 i proved the completeness theorem and the  compactness theorem for predicate logic  you should have read van dalen  through page 118  note that in this course we are only interested in the  countable case so you do not need to worry about larger cardinalities nor  do you have to remember zorns lemma     on monday oct 7 i introduced ehrenfeuchtfraisse games  these are  the best and most pleasant way to figure out what can and cannot be  expressed in firstorder logics  by then you should have read the handout  pebble games  from my forthcoming book  descriptive complexity       on wednesday oct 9 i finished the introduction to predicate logic  by now  please skim the rest of chapter 3 of van dalen  topics that you should pay  particular attention to are substructures isomorphism elementary  equivalence and skolemization     second  problem set due oct 16 1996       on oct 16 i introduced evolving  algebra  please read the  evolving  algebra tutorial and the paper guideps  these are available as   postscript files from anonymous ftp site ftpeecsumichedu directory  groupsealgebras files tutorialps and guideps     on oct 21 i concluded my presentation of evolving algebras using  the paper why use evolving algebras for hardware and software  engineering by egon b rger proc sofsem95 springer lncs  also  available on the evolving  algebra homepage  i also talked briefly about denotational semantics  using denotational semantics by joseph stoy 1977 mit press  chapter 9 by way of comparison     on oct 23 28 and 30 i will give a threelecture introduction to modal logics  emphasizing temporal logic and logics of knowledge  please read the article by  vardi why is modal logic so robustly decidable which i handed out i  will also use some material from the book by fagin halpern moses and vardi  reasoning about knowledge 1995 mit press     on monday nov 4 i will talk about about an interesting paper that uses  logic of knowledge to discuss security in distributed systems   a  logic of authentication by burrows abadi and needham  please read  this paper before the class     on wednesday nov 6 through monday nov 18 i will talk about lamports   temporal logic of actions     you might want to look at the following webpage which has many  pointers to work going on in formal methods  formal methods pointers     on wednesday nov 20 i will start talking about computation tree  logic and model checking  for a preview take at look at the following homepage  model  checking at cmu     available slots for student lectures are nov 27 dec 2 dec 4 and  dec 11  i suggest that you get your reservations in early     there will be no class on monday dec 9
