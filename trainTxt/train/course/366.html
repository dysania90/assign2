which is data structures analysis of algorithms data abstraction and abstract data types objectoriented programming proofs of correctness complexity and computability sorting and searching      however cps 100e assumes no prior knowledge of c this is assumed in cps 100  instead students are expected to have prior experience programming with functions arrays and ideally recordsstructs as might be learned in a course using pascal or c students who do well on the advanced placement computer science a exam 45 or who earn a 3 on the ab exam should elect this course  complete   information on choosing a first course in computer science is accessble      texts        a computer science tapestry exploring programming and computer science with c by owen astrachan mcgrawhill        algorithms data structures and problems solving with c  by mark weiss addisonwesley       optional  introduction to the public clusters at duke  available at gothic bookshop      optional  c how to program  deitel and deitel        computing     all programs should compile and execute on acpub sun workstations  they should be compiled with g v 272  you will need to alter your path to have access to this version of the compiler  sparc clusters are found in teer 106 139 hudson hall socpsych 133 biosci 002cc and carr 125  all programsprojects will be submitted electronically      collaboration     you may and should work with someone else on programs you may  not  collaborate on written assignments or quizzes  for each assigment you are expected to include a list of consultants and collaborators as part of the readme that must be submitted  you may not work with the same person on two consecutive assignments without prior permission       grading            major programming assignments   30       writtenminor programming assignments   10       labs   8       random quizzes   6       tests 2   26       final   20        grading is done on an absolute but adjustable scale  this means that there is no curve  anyone earning 90 or more of the total number of points available will receive a grade in the a range 80  b 70  c 60  d this scale may go down but it will not go up  in order to earn an a you must do several of the optional assignments  these points count even if you dont earn an a     there will be several optional assignments  completion of these can earn points towards raising a grade by a halfstep eg from c to b in some cases it may be possible to raise a grade by more than one step completion of some of the optional assignments is mandatory in order to earn an a     the tests will be closedbook the final exam will be open book     random quizzes will be given out in class and then flippedfor at the beginning of the next class      late assignments      assignments have an early due date and a final due date  normally these dates will be on monday at midnight assignments turned in on the early due date will earn a 10 bonus based on the total value of the assignment      assignments turned in after the final due date are penalized 25 no assignment will be accepted more than one week after the final due date exceptions to this rule may be granted in advance but not after the fact       newsgroup and mail     you should monitor the newsgroup dukecscps100e on a regular basis  information about changes in assignments due dates and hintshelp will be posted there  news is the preferred forum for askinganswering questions     you may want to ask questions by email this is ok  if you have a question about code you should submit the code all relevant files using the appropriate submit command and send email  you should set up acl permission on your cps100e directory for the professor and tauta to have access to the directory      world wide web     all course materials except for daily notes are accessible from the class home page  this page is accessible from the duke course page and from prof astrachans homepage  the url is    hows that for selfreferential       dishonesty policy     you may discuss problems with other students but strong collaboration is limited to one partner on major programming assignments  if you have such a partner your writeup and final program should still be your own except for the final projects  when a group can submit one program you must work on your own on written assignments an on minor programming assignments  if you get help of a substantive nature on an assignment you must acknowledge this assistance in your readme file         course materials and handouts         syllabus
