understand write and evolve typical smallhigherlevel  programs       course goals      in this class we expect students to learn      what makes up computer science    how to write simple programs in the ada programming language and    how to solve problems using a computer    this class has no prerequisites            another document gives a more detailed list  of topics to be covered in this class          students often come with a wide variety of backgrounds and  vastly different experience  as a consequence some students may be bored and some may be lost  your patience support of your classmates  and participation in class are appreciated      textbook      the textbook for this class is the    nell dale chip weems and john mccormick  programming and problem solving with ada  d c

clarity and good style  a shorter extract from this document will be handed out in lab          a lengthy and detailed guide for the development of  wellconstructed programs in general can be found in

class and to work the exercises at the end of  the chapters        grading      there will be three midterms and a final in the class  lab projects will count 45 of the total grade  each midterm will count 10 and the final 25  each exam and lab project will be assigned a numeric score  the average numeric score  is roughly equivalent to a b letter grade  the letter grade for the class will be assigned to each student  based on the weighted sum of these numeric scores  your grade is determined by how you do relatively to the rest  of the class  not by the magnitude of your numeric scores          all work is to be your own  on tests be sure to explain your answers as if you were  tutoring someone else                  for each student the  numeric scores for the lab  assignments and exams are recorded  if you have any question about your standing in the class  or if some score has been recorded wrong  please contact me immediately  corrections will not be made long after the due
