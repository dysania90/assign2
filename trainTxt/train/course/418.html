especially in the context of multimedia systems  the goal is an  architecture where these separate components share more by way   of common concepts and structures and less through procedural interfaces        the intention here is to conceptualize and implement multimedia  objects having semantically relevant structure amenable to querying  and manipulation in contrast to current multimedia systems which lack  the database perspective of data independence and associated query  capabilities and to current databases which treat multimedia objects  as blobs  if at all        the seminar will develop prototype implementations which present  diverse information  such as movies sound tracks and even  traditional relational data  within a unified conceptual framework  and presentation environment  this implementation will be done by  teams who bring a variety of experiences to bear on the multifaceted  issues which will arise         lecture schedule overview   toc

sengupta structured documents as multimedia databases    documents have been a big source of information for almost all of the  history of human civilization however until recently information in  documents was not being used propoerly because of poor structuring of  documents introduceion to structured documents using tags or  markups have majorly changed this situation and tagged electronic  texts are becoming more and more widespread as sources of information        markup languages such as sgml standard generalized markup language  goldfarb charles 1990 have been introduced  for creating structured documents but extracting the information  based on the structures in the documents is still not a very simple  issue and in most cases it is ad hoc and based on primitive word  searches        this talk would introduce structured documents and sgml and discuss  some of the ways of extracting information out of tagged documents in  particular some present directions toward this area would be  discussed along with examples advantages and disadvantages   lincoln carr querying sgml documents     the standard generalized markup language or sgml and the data type  definitions or dtds built up from it provide the basis for storing  documents in a way that allows complex querying  the text encoding  initiative or tei uses sgml to create standard dtds for such  document types as poetry and dramatei  1994 currently tei has encoded a large body of poetry using its  standards into the english poetry database for which a simple query  engine is available  however since the poems are not marked up using  the fullest potential of teis standard many useful more complex  types of queries are not presently possible         march 1     logic seminar           march 6     bob penrod the evolution of visualization tools for large   information spaces     large information spaces present several problems for  visualization such spaces require tools that visualize all the  necessary data and facilitate comprehension of global structure most  traditional tools provide a simple window that displays a limited  extent of data this is problematic because 1 not all the data is  concurrently visible 2 navigation through the data is slow and 3  no attempt at providing context is made      the perspective wall mackinlay  jd robertson gg card sk 1991 attempts to handle these  problems by integrating detail and context we will examine two  precursors to the perspective wall generalized fisheye views  furnas gw 1986 and the bifocal  display spence r apperley m 1982  focusing in particular on the application of those ideas to   linear information spaces     weizhen hu interactive video technology    ordinary video applications only allow users to access and  replay movies passively interactive video technology  introduced in    yoshinobu tonomura et al 1994  allows users to do more operations about the  video such as grasping the main idea of the video fast  browsing searching analyzing and editing three topics are  talked about here 1 video segmentation and feature extraction  2 fast browing method 3 new video interfaces         march 8     torrin sanders hypermedia product evaluation     xingchun zheng an intelligent multimedia system    hypermedia provides poeple with a new way to combine different media into   single artefacts  these can be developed and marketed in the style of   conventional media publications  multimedia technologies not only being the   presentation of data stored as images sound and video but also allow the   incorporation of media specific input modeseg natural language speech   pen gesture and the generation of images sound and video from more   abstract formats     in using an intelligent agent to mediate multibase information access   w behrendt e hutchinson   kg jeffrey ca macnee md wilson 1993 the mips project    multimedia   presentation system is introduced in the paper as  a presentation of    an open preauthored hypermedia network stored in the hytime standard   format with  dynamically created web nodes containing answers to conventional   database queries this illustrates how conventional hypermedia tools can be   extended to include intelligent automatic generation of multimedia   presentations from retrieved data an example multimodel systemmmi2 is   described to illustrate the technologies which could be brought to the   market independently       the above concepts and ideas are still in the research stage         march 20       qizhen zhang videoondemand and database related issues an  introduction      videoondemand features a new form of information delivery that is  causing a great commotion in the industries of cable tv  telecommunications personal computers and software  in this  revolution multimedia database design and management play an  indispesable role  this talk briefly describes the architecture the  technology and the experimental implementations of this emerging  application  by means of the description potential database issues  are explored  as an example i am going to discuss network support for dynamically scaled multimedia  data streams in some depth     robert fahey video object servers and video ondemand    recently video ondemand has received quite a bit of attention in the  media  however the media rarely discuss how it will be implemented  in this talk i shall examine the requirements needed to support  realtime video and how current technology meets these requirements  i will also describe several approaches to providing ondemand video  some issues which will be investigated are throughput requirements for  video throughput and seektime for several secondary storage devices  optimizationorganization techniques to improve throughputresponse time  and several types of architectures to support video objects      this presentation is based on five different papers ranging from continuous  media storage to the cost effectiveness of video ondemand systems  these  papers are lougher p and shepherd d 1993   rangan p and vin h 1993  federighi c and rowe l 1994  ghandeharizadeh s and ramos l 1993 and  doganata y and tantawi a 1994           march 22     kaushik mody an introduction to atm  asynchronous transfer mode      computer networks have revolutionized the way we communicate and  interact the data around the world however with distributed  multimedia becoming norms rather than exception the existing networks  are not able to support the high bandwidth and low latency  requirements of its applications asynchronous transfer mode a  switching and multiplexing technique is described as a technology that  will allow total flexibility and efficiency to be achieved in  tomorrows high speed multiservice multimedia networks  this  presentation is based on the work by  ronald  j vetter david h c du 1995 and b g kim and p wang 1995     alan keahey multiresolution information display     this talk will take a look at some techniques for displaying  information at more than one level of resolution  simulataneously while similar in scope to the recent talk given by  bob penrod the focus will be more on the details of hyperbolic or  fisheye views implementation issues and possibilities for future  systems such as multifocus systems           march 27     yong jiang matadata in video databases     video is composed of audiovisual information providing content based   access to video data is essential for the sucessful integration of video   into computers organizing video for content based access requires the use   of video matadata this papter explores the nature of video matadata a data   model for video databases is presented based on a study of the applilcations   of video the nature of video retrieval requests and the features of video   the data model is used in the architectural framework of a video database   the current state of technology in video databases is summarized and research   issues are highlighted     aditya khosla towards an optimal operating system for multimedia     my talk will be based on a survey paper that addresses key issues that an operating system  needs to possess in order to efficiently handle multimedia systems the aspects that  i will discuss include process management and related scheduling strategies i will  further talk about resource management  file management and memory  management issues in this context with  alternative algorithms  examined and the options that best suit such systems         march 29     chialin chou       julia dymshitz  approaches to database interface design   approaches to humancomputer interaction hci can be broadly  classified into four categoriesempirical predictive modelling  cognitive and anthropomorphic eberts  re 1994  each of these approaches emphasizes a different aspect  of hci although many research studies fall into more than one  category   cognitive and anthropomorphic approaches were applied  extensively to database interface design producing a number of design  guidelines  the usefulness of these guidelines for actual design will  be discussed in the context of advantages and disadvantages of each  approach in addition two articles williams  md 1984 and eberts re and bittianda  kp 1993 will be described in greater detail to illustrate the  application of cognitive and anthropomorphic methods to database  interface issues         april 5     arijit sengupta   lincoln carr         april 10     aditya
