grading policy    your final grade is based on seven programming assignments each worth 5 not including program 0 and three exams  your highest two exam scores will each contribute 25 to your final grade your lowest exam score will contribute 15  you must complete and hand in all the assignments to be eligible to receive a passing grade for the course  final grades for all cs 302 sections are

ensure a good grade regardless of your performance on the assignments  all exams are approximately two hours long though you may stay a bit longer if you need extra time and are closedbook  you only need to bring a pen or pencil to exams  calculators are not necessary or even useful    exam solutions       midterm exam 1     midterm exam 2      there are seven programming assignments not including program 0 each contributing 5 to your final grade  all the assignments must be completed and handed in to be eligible to receive a passing grade for the course  you must attempt to complete every programming assignment  if you hand in a program that does not run or will not even compile without errors then it will not be graded and will automatically receive a zero grade and you risk

they wear name tags and are on duty from approximately 800 am to 1100 pm  consultants can answer short questions about compiler error messages and program syntax as well as how to login use the printers send email run netscape etc               click here for more information about the consultants                      instructor     general questions about an assignment or questions that may require a long explanation are best answered by myself  please see me during office hours or send me email  i am not normally in my office except during office hours because i do my dissertation research from home via a modem  therefore if you want to see me outside of office hours please make an appointment first  you can most easily contact me by email because i regularly login and read my email from home               click here to send me email                       problem solving exercises    one of the most important skills you will learn in this class is problem solving  good problem solving skills distinguish a good computer programmer from a bad one  it doesnt matter how familiar or skilled you are in a particular programming language if you do not understand how to solve the problem then you will not be able to write a computer program for it in any language      to help you learn problem solving skills and techniques i will assign weekly problem solving exercises  these will be small but nontrivial problems which i will give out each monday  you should look at the problem and think about it during the week and right down the steps you would go through to solve the problem ie the overall structure of your program  this is primarily an exercise in general problem solving so you do not have to write any fortran code though you may if you want to and have time and your solutionalgorithm should not even be dependent on a particular programming language such as fortran  each friday we will go over the solution in class      exercises

hewlettpackard vectras running microsoft windows and microsoft fortran  this lab is open from 700 am to 100 am seven days a week except certain holidays  the printer room is located across the hall in rm 1359      you may also use your home or dorm computers to write your programs however you will probably have to purchase your own copy of microsoft fortran or lahey personal fortran see the inside cover of the textbook  you may also work in any of the other computer labs on campus however most do not have fortran compilers please see me first before using the cae lab      the software you will be using in the lab includes         microsoft windows and msdos     email     netscape           other pointers of interest        cs 302 home page      gareth bestors home page      computer
