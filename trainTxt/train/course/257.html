professors   almeida  bestavros  crovella and  yates  time monday 13 pm  location mcs b46  credit may be taken as audit or for up to 4 credits   course description  this seminar will take a handson approach to examining the design of current networked computing systems  in particular we will adopt as our case study the software system associated with a world wide web server the course will consist of code walkthroughs and lectures  code walkthroughs will include at the kernel level namely in linux the network file system and process scheduling functions and at the application level one web server apache lectures will cover research issues in server design performance modeling and simulation techniques  this seminar will be a prerequisite or corequisite for participating in the commonwealth server project which is being led by the instructors however any student who is interested in studying the implementation of a networked computer system is invited to attend  we will be asking attendees to be notetakers for a week  as a notetaker your job is to keep track of the main themes of the  discussion and any interesting points made by any of the participants      participation in this seminar is by encouragementconsent of one of the instructors students taking this course for credit will be expected to complete a related project chosen in consultation with one of the instructors  the project cannot serve also as a masters project however if a twophase proposal is accepted by the instructor the second phase can serve as a ms project  students may form teams to work on projects however the project scope must scale linearly with the team size and work must be explicitly load balanced in a fair way  its also ok to take this course for no credit but to use it to lead on to an ms project during a subsequent semester      we will schedule a brownbag or two at the end of the semester each student participating will be asked to talk for a short time 10 mins on their project or on a related topic      finally for more information on the commonwealth server project follow  this link  course schedule  heres the proposed weekbyweek schedule of topics wed like to cover during weeks 5 through 9 our code walkthroughs will take us through version 2010 of the linux kernel see  linux2010 under swcoursecs835f96 during weeks 10 and 11 our code walkthroughs will be through version 111 of the apache server see apache111 in the same place if youre a presenter or a scribe for a particular week please mail your notes to djycsbuedu so that they can be linked
