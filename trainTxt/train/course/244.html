technologies are finding more and more uses in computer  applications and user interfaces this seminar will survey the technology  of digital audio signal processing dasp and computer music and discuss  several of the important topics in these fields we will discuss the  technology of digital sound representation synthesis processing and  recording as well as topics related to virtual reality multimedia tools  electronic games and media data transmission the readings will be taken  from the leading journals and books in the field such as computer music  journal acm computing surveys ieee computer and various books and  conference proceedings participants will also have access to a range of  software tools and www resources for optional online experimentation    the topics will include      digital audio signals and their representation     analysissynthesis techniques and software sound synthesis     sound localization and the synthesis of localization cues
