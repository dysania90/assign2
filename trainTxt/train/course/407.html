sections for fall 1996 is acc335 on the computer science departmental network we will use the newsgroup heavily to convey a variety of course information including questions and answers about lecture and laboratory procedures and problems you should check the newsgroup frequently to keep up to date and you should feel free to contribute questions and solutions about procedural problems and constructive comments  course grade    3 inclass openbook exams  20     60  laboratory                           35  collected homework                    5       homework policy   homework assignments are due in class at the end of class on the due date late homework will not be accepted the instructional staff will post solutions on the class newsgroup or in the laboratory lindley hall 135 some questions on the homework may not be graded at the instructors discretion however solutions to all questions will be posted      laboratory   the lab meets in lindley hall 135 your ai will discuss lab procedures in your regular lab section you should bring to lab the c335 lab manual you will receive additional handouts and information in class or in lab       attendance   attendance in class and laboratory is expected our experience shows a clear relation between good attendance and good performance both the lectures and the laboratory sessions discuss much material that is not available in the textbook or lab manual there will be frequent handouts but without the benefit of the lecture or lab discussion the handouts will usually be opaque     academic integrity  read the computer science departments statement on academic integrity to be sure you understand the rules under which computer science courses operate  cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the office of student ethics a branch of the office of the dean of students  withdrawal  the last day to drop a course with an automatic w is 30 october 1996 after that date a student may withdraw only with the permission of the dean of the college of arts and sciences this approval is normally given only for urgent reasons related to extended illness or equivalent distress  incomplete grade  an incomplete i final grade will be given only by prior arrangement in exceptional circumstances conforming to university and departmental policy in which the bulk of course work has been completed in passing fashion          c335 computer structures course description      in c335 students study computer systems and problem solving in the context of basic computer hardware and lowlevel software systems the emphasis is on fundamental properties of computer systems that apply across a broad range of computers and systems the abstractions are reinforced in class and in the laboratory  in the laboratory students extend their problemsolving skills by working at the level of computer assembly language using a modern microcomputer system such as the 68000 although the class and laboratory proceed on their own schedules the lab applies many of the fundamental concepts dealt with in lecture and the lecture provides the foundation for the lab  both class and lab emphasize a disciplined structured approach to programming     topics are selected from the following list topics marked with a star  might be included in an honors course     number systems and arithmetic   conversions among various number bases such as decimal binary hexadecimal and arbitrary base integer and fraction conversions  number representations for signed arithmetic signed magnitude twos complement ones
