operating system provides a wellknown convenient and efficient  interface between user programs and the bare hardware of the computer  on which they run  the operating system is responsible for allowing  resources eg disks networks and processors to be shared  providing common services needed by many different programs eg  file service the ability to start or stop processes and access to  the printer and protecting individual programs from one another  the course will start with a brief historical perspective of the  evolution of operating systems over the last fifty years and then  cover the major components of most operating systems  this discussion  will cover the tradeoffs that can be made between performance and  functionality during the design and implementation of an operating  system  particular emphasis will be given to three major os  subsystems process management memory management and the file  system and operating system support for distributed systems      requirements and grading     6 homeworks 15     3 programming projects 45     3 exams 40  inclass open book and open notes     exam 1 first 13 of course   exam 2 second 13 of course   final exam 75 on final 13 of course and 25 over first 23s  of course        the course will be graded on a curve  you are expected to attend  class regularly read the assigned reading before class and  participate in class discussions         late policies        this course covers a lot of material  to make it easier to learn i  have divided the course into many small components  this division  means late assignments will seriously impact your ability to learn the  next section of the course  therefore i have the following strict  late policies        homework   no late homeworks will be accepted  since several  homeworks are due right before an exam the solutions will be  published on the day the homework is due and therefore no late  assignments will be accepted  i give homeworks to enable you to apply  what you are learning in class before an exam  they are not a large  portion of your grade but doing homework will improve your  performance on exams a much larger portion of your grade and it is  therefore to your benefit to do all the homeworks and turn them in on  the deadline  again regardless of the circumstances you will not  get any credit for late homework assignments        labs   if you turn in your lab late you will receive a 10  penalty for each day after em or portion thereof that the  assignment was due up to three days  individual extensions without  penalty will be granted only in extreme circumstances serious illness  with a doctors note   it is unfair to the rest of the class if  i give certain individuals extensions so plan accordingly and start  on your assignments early        exams   if you will miss an exam or a significant amount  of class time you  must  tell me ahead of time  make up exams  will be oral and based on previous experience will be tougher than  the original exam        cooperation and cheating    feel free to discuss homework and labs with other members of the  class myself or the ta  however do not look at or copy another  students solution to a homework or lab  i am not concerned with  how you come to understand the problem and how to solve it but once  you have the background necessary to solve it you must provide your  own solution  exchanging homework or lab solutions is cheating and  will be dealt with according to university policies       complete  syllabus and course policies     acknowledgements    i used course materials from tom anderson john carter hank levy and  thomas narten to prepare the lecture notes homeworks labs and  exams thanks
