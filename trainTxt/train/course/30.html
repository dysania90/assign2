member concerning the project we will be   undertaking    conformance to standards you will each have an  area of primary responsibility as part of the class team executing  the class project the quality assurance manager and the configuration  manager will enforce the standards for the class the independent  verification and validation engineer will further evaluate   conformance as an agent of the customer instructor conformance  to the standards is clearly to your benefit besides which   experience has shown that adherence to standards results in producing  working programs in less time    turning in assignments for each of the  assignments you should turn in your solution to each attach an  assignment coversheet that includes your name student number  email address a telephone

in those cases where the instructor chooses  to accept them a severe grading penalty will apply remember that  all of the other students your development teammates will depend  on your contribution to the project    class scenario      you have recently been hired by a prestigious software company    because the company has just won one of two contracts to upgrade    a government developed training aid called the low cost flight    simulator lcfs at the end of the development phase a single    contract will be awarded to the company that wins a competitive    product flyoff demonstration your companys future depends    on winning this competition your talentladen tiger team must     develop the upgrade to this product to allow it to win the    flyoff product maintainability is included in
