introduction to computer programming    sections 1amp2 fortran      cs 110 is a onecredit course which covers the basic programming structures needed to prepare students for cs 310 and elementary engineering courses  no prior computer programming experience is required and only a basic knowledge of computers is assumed  the material covered will enable you to write simple computer programs to solve engineering problems in elementary courses  all programming is done in fortran  this course is intended for students who received little or no programming instruction in high school      this section is taught entirely in the fortran programming language and is intended primarily for engineering students and noncomputer science majors click here for a course description        menu

           grading policy    your final grade is based on four programming assignments each worth 25 not including program 0 this course is creditno credit only there are no tests or exams       100  assignments 4  24 each  1 for 4           syllabus tentative    the following topics and sections of the text will be approximately covered each week during the semester  you will only get the most out of this class if you read the relevant sections of the text before coming to class  this way you will be able to ask questions in class about anything that you are unsure of instead of waiting until youre in the lab trying to work on an assignment to discover you didnt really understand something         weeks 18           text and lecture notes    text  fortran with engineering applications 5th edition by e koffman and f friedman 1993      lecture notes  copies of the lecture notes will be available online at the end of each week of class important  the online lecture notes are not a substitute for coming to class  they do not include any examples or additional notes that i put on the board except for week1  you are responsible for all the material covered in class        week1  week2            programming assignments    there are four programming assignments each contributing 25 to your final grade  you must attempt to complete every programming assignment  if you hand in a program that does not run or will not even compile without errors then it will get a very low mark check the gradesheets and you risk failing the course           gradesheets     what to do

approximately 800 am to 1100 pm  consultants can answer short questions about compiler error messages and program syntax as well as how to login use the printers send email run netscape etc               click here for more information about the consultants                      instructor     general questions about an assignment or questions that may require a long explanation are best answered by myself  please see me during office hours or send me email  i am not normally in my office except during office hours because i do my research from home via a modem  therefore if you want to see me outside of office hours please make an appointment first  you can most easily contact me by email because i regularly login and read my email from home if you mail from netscape make sure to include your name and email address as they dont show up for me so i wont know who mailed me and be able to respond otherwise               click here to send me email                       problem solving exercises    one of the most important skills you will learn in this class is problem solving  good problem solving skills distinguish a good computer programmer from a bad one  it doesnt matter how familiar or skilled you are in a particular programming language if you do not understand how to solve the problem then you will not be able to write a computer program for it in any language      to help you learn problem solving skills and techniques i will assign weekly problem solving exercises  these will be small but nontrivial problems which i will give out each monday  you should look at the problem and think about it during the week and right down the steps you would go through to solve the problem ie the overall structure of your program  this is primarily an exercise in general problem solving so you do not have to write any fortran code though you may if you want to and have time and your solutionalgorithm should not even be dependent on a particular programming language such as fortran  we will go over the solution in class the following monday      exercises                computer lab    you will be using the vectra lab in rm 1350 computer science amp statistics containing hewlettpackard vectras running microsoft windows and microsoft fortran  this lab is open from 700 am to 100 am seven days a week except certain holidays  the printer room is located across the hall in rm 1359 you have a quota of 300 pages on which   to print once you exceed that quota you must contact the lab either by email or by going to room 2310 during office hours they prefer email to pay to increase your quota    beware some of the machines in the vectra lab arent configured correctly in particular the machines along the wall closest to the outside  hallway towards the lefthand part of the room try to avoid those if you can    you may also use your home or dorm computers to write your programs however you will probably have to purchase your own copy of microsoft fortran or lahey personal fortran see the inside cover of the textbook  you may also work in any of the other computer labs on campus however most do not have fortran compilers please see me first before using the cae lab      the software you will be using in the lab includes         microsoft windows and msdos     email     netscape           other pointers of interest        cs 110 home page      jeff
