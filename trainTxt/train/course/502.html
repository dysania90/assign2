code we will review thursday oct 3 is  in file cs130afilesllistc  you may one to see the one used last year  which does the same thing but in a slightly  different way  that program is in file  cs130afiles95llistc         copy them into your directory and type  g llistc         then type  aout         sample input one number per line  6  7  5  4  3  0  7  6  8  9  1  2  3  0          october 9 1996   300 pm            you may use the listitarator class for the hw as long  as it results in a time efficient procedure  as without it time efficient with respect to o notation         for problem two if you do inserts inserts1  insertf  results in very inefficient code  so just implement the operation  directly          remember we want time efficient code but do not try to optimize to the  last bit ie do not try to reduce to the last bit the constant c  in the o notation for the time complexity           october 11 1996   500 pm              typo in hw in the sorting algorithm problem 6d         replace if count  0              by if count  0             october 15 1996   500 pm          comments on the project      1    use g      2    note that k is either zero or it is a positive integer gt 2      3    typos  replace retured by returned  replace occurence by occurance  replace occurences by occurances  replace ingnore by ignore  replace clases by classes       4  an example for the project is in cs130afilesexample      comments on the project      the root node in both figures should have a 9 instead of an 8              october 16 1996   100 pm           comments on the project         the root node in both figures should have a 9 instead of an 8           october 17 1996   100 pm           just called the rbr and they said the old midterms for cs130a  are there  if they are not listed then ask the person in the counter  directly           october 18 1996   500 pm           as we said in the first handout you must work in the project  and homeworks individually        as i said before in the project my member functions should  not be your final memeber functions  the purpose of the functions  is to give examples on how to acceess the data  however the data  in the nodes should be left untouched        in the project handout page 6 i say that x is followed by a cr  i should have said that x is followed by a cr or a blank  the same holds for string y   a little c program to read data is in file cs130afilesreadc          october 18 1996   700 pm          in the project i say that when a arraytrienode or a linkedtrienode  has a count that becomes 1 it should become a tinytrienode  that is incorrect sorry about that  it becomes a tinytrienode  when in addition to the count being 1 the strends is true          october 21 1996   1030 pm              the homeworks have been graded  you can pick them  up during my office hours today from 12           the solutions are in the rbr  they are also in  the file cs130afileshw1ps          you can print that file or view it with ghostscript hw1ps  the press the left bottom on the dismiss sign if it appears  put the mouse insede the window and type cr to advance the page  additional information on ghostview appears when you type   man hw1ps            in the hw it should say that bogdan cocosel is a coauthor  of the solutions             october 22 1996   200 pm           oops  i forgot to add this  but here it is  in the file cs130afilesprojc and the  file cs130afilesprojhc you will find code  to access and create the two examples in the project  handout  you can copy them into your directory  compile it and run it          october 28 1996   1030 am           as we say in the project description we are dealing with sets so  we do not keep multiple copies of the same word in the same set  also the input is error free but one might try to insert  a word in a set that is already there or delete a word that  is not in a set  in the first case you must not insert the word and  the count needs to remain unchanged  in the second case the count must  remain unchanged and nothing must be deleted  note that this is important  to facilitate testing        if you implement insert as in the class  notes you will have to make to passes  over the trie in some cases either to   update the count when inserting a new word or  unupdating the count if it was updated incorrectly  because the word was already there         you can create a member function whoami defined like  getnext to return the type of object you have for derived  classes like tinytrienode etc             october 28 1996   1530 pm           remember that the final type of a node depends on the  number of words in that subtree  it does not depend on the number of nodes  or the number of nonnull pointers in that subtree                 october 31 1996   1515 pm           the office hours of the tas on wednesday and friday will be in csil  from now till december        if you would like csil to be open during the thankgiving holidays  please send email to humphreycs  it would be nice if you  specify the times and days you want it be open and if you would  like to babysit the machines                          under construction        current weather mapsmovies        a beginners guide to html        the c virtual library        do not click here
