our machine muddcs are to find it leave the back of the lecture hall galileo edwards turn right then another right down the long corridor  proceed to the new section of the building then turn right  102 is the second door on the right     to get to my office go back to the long corridor and keep going to  the end  go right then upstairs you will then be in the olin building  then go left then left again to the southeast corner of olin  my office is 242 which is inside of 240  240 is always open during business hours my door is usually closed to filter out noise but dont hesitate to knock     catalog description introduction to principles of computer science  algorithms complexity analysis data structuring data and procedural abstraction grammars  correctness logic principles processor organization operating system  concepts programming languages basic automata theory and theoretical  limitations    course goals  to learn and apply basic principles of computer science including software construction hardware organization and limitations of computers      text robert m keller  principles of computing january 1996 available by onetime special order for 29 cost of reproduction and it is strongly recommended that you buy a copy  the entire book is also online in microsoft word on kato the mac server in the folder katohomedepartment homescscs 60  it will be thus viewable from macs on the local network  i will see about getting a pc version as well  however it is still recommended that you purchase the book rather than say getting someones old version because 1 the book has been revised substantially since the last course offering  2 the book is large 750 pages and reading it all on the screen is apt to be tiresome and inconvenient  3 the book can be taken into the exams whereas a mac cannot be     course assumptions  students should have had a first course in computing at the college level eg cs5  prior experience in c or c is preferred although not essential  others have made it through starting with just a knowledge of pascal  you should know about procedures arrays and types at a minimum if you are unfamiliar with these please take cs5 or cs50 first  lectures  the word lecture below is used very loosely  i expect that the lecture periods will include some explanation but will be more like a  multilogue set of dialogues  you are expected to attend ask questions and provide comments  threads  there are essentially three interwoven threads in the course the book the problems and the lectures  i try to keep them in synch with one another but active participation in all three threads is required volumewise the book covers more material than can be discussed in the lecture  the lecture will cover some things not in the book staying attune to what is going on in lecture will help you focus on the areas in the book that are important as far as exam emphasis   the problems exercise some but not all of the things discussed in the book and lecture  resources  the course is planned to be interactive throughout  we are eager to prevent programming difficulties from consuming extraordinary time so please ask when you get stuck with such difficulties  it is much more efficient to start early on each assignment so that you give yourself enough time to cope with the numerous contingencies which inevitably materialize  you can get help online by emailing to cs60helpmuddcs which goes to the graderstutors and to me  i dont enable talk because it is too slow but i check email often  when you email a message it will typically be answered to the entire class with parts of your message embedded  if you do not want it to be attributed to you please so indicate in your message      by carrying problem solutions through to computer implementation you are showing that you understand the issues principles and techniques  i will explain to you how to work any problem to any level of detail if you ask  however you must do so with a sufficient time margin  telling me at the eleventh hour that you just arent getting and therefore want to drop the course is not availing yourself of the substantial help available     you are also welcome to submit email or a note card with any question youd like to have answered or any point you would like addressed before or after class or leave it in my mailbox in 240 olin  of course you are encouraged to ask such questions in class as well  there are many tools available on the computer itself  use the man feature of unix to find what you need and to explore  the command   man command   gives information on a specific command  the command   man k topic   lists commands relating to a specific topic  you can also use the info reader in gnu emacs for certain library language and editor specifics  in emacs type   escapex info  helpful information examples online copies of assignments etc will be kept in various subdirectories of the directory   cscs60  on machine muddcs  there is a web page for rex documentation  finally the corner store maxim applies if you cant find what you want ask for it      grading there will be approximately eight assignments entailing programming programming assignments help drive home key working concepts and principles  after the first couple of assignments where the rex language one you have not likely seen is used the language used will mostly be c  c is used due to its position as an emergent industry standard and its ability to reflect both lowlevel computer structure and at the same time provide highlevel data and object abstractions  there will may be one assignment in assemblylanguage programming using a simulated computer the isc  as prior exposure to c varies across the class i will hold one or more special evening sessions for c if you so request    is this a programming course  although much of the course entails programming we  consider exposure to computer science ideas to be the important part  the intent of the programming assignments is to drive home these key ideas  i am willing to devote as much of each class period as is needed nominally 15 minutes to more detailed examples of programming techniques and for specific programming questions and answers  if this does not appear useful on a given day the time will be used for other purposes        honor code standard  read this carefully although discussion of problems with others is encouraged programming in cs60 emphasizes individual learning rather than group projects  we observe the following standard  you may discuss the assignment with other students  you may not share  give or receive written work of any kind inside or outside the course elaboration  in the case of programming assignments we consider email computer files fragments of files and printed output to be written work  in developing code for a programming assignment you can discuss ideas with others but discussion of ideas must not involve wholesale examination or  transcription of the actual working code of others with the exception that you may use any code explicitly provided by the instructor definitely forbidden is a form of collaboration wherein two or more students split up an assignment then transcribe each others contributions sometimes changing names of variables comments formatting etc   if this occurs a failing grade is issued automatically if the help you get from another is significant you should acknowledge it on your submission  you do not lose credit for this if you have any doubts about whether a form of interaction constitutes a violation of this standard please consult with me prior to continuing     grading weights the programming assignments will constitute 50 of the grade  the midterm examination will count 15 and the final 25  class attendance participation random quizzes etc will account for the remaining 10  various practice problems will be indicated  in particular you should be able to work most  two dot problem in the notes relating to material covered in lecture  these do not need to be submitted but the exams will consist largely of problems of a similar level along with some perhaps a little easier or harder exams are open book and emphasize conceptual understanding rather than memorization of fine details      late assignment policy  submissions are done by emailing source code to the grader cs60gradmuddcs which also establishes the time of submission the due dates on assignments should be noted carefully the work of an assignment should be conducted in the week or weeks before not on the last day when there is no space for the necessary thinking   there is an automatic fixed oneday grace period on all assignments   in other words if the due date states day n then the assignment must be turned in before midnight on day n1 to receive any credit  after midnight on day n1 work you spend on the problem is for you own edification only which is not  to say that it isnt worth doing or required you just dont get points for it then  it is best to plan to get the assignments in on the stated due date    cs 60 topic outline  the lectures will roughly follow this outline  the progression is at the rate of about two of the numbered topics below per week  i should say that this is what i would like to do  depending on background some of the topics expand to longer than allocated with the result that other topics get jettisoned or fall off the end  please keep up on the reading without it being explicitly assigned  the notes generally expand on the lectures and discussions  but the lectures may also expand on the notes or introduce new material  more often than not several threads will be interwoven in the lectures over a period of time in part to emphasize the commonality of concepts from different vantage points  brackets below indicate where chapters in the notes start with respect to the concepts that follow  the outline does not mention every topic  the actual lectures determine points of emphasis     computing by the rules  computation problems and models of computation states and transitions  list notation   functional specifications
