1994       the three goals of this course            learn about data communications and networks    enhance your skills at preparing and presenting material before an  audience   enhance your skills at preparing and writing a significant survey paper          the approach         everyone will participate fully in the class sessions each student is  expected to read and reflect on forthcoming material and be prepared to help  all of us learn more about data communications          the instructor and the students will share the lecturing responsibilities  augmented by several presentations by computer science staff students will  write at least one survey paper those students who present lectures on a  topic will write one paper other students will write two papers        as a rough guide i suggest that your total effort in this course might be  distributed as follows preparation and followup for the course lectures  50 preparation and presentation of each lecture topic or paper 25        i will allocate lecture topics based on the needs of the course and the  desires of the participants i will attempt to have the lecture schedule  firmed up by the third class period see the lecture schedule for the current  schedule        each lecturer will develop and present the topic and will make available a  list of sources and other appropriate materials to allow the members of the  class to prepare for and participate in the lectures following your lecture  you will assign and grade a brief but relevant homework the lecture topics  will generally follow the structure of our main textbook check guidelines for lecturers for some hints  for preparing and delivering a good lecture        for each paper you write you will propose a topic and should secure my  approval before you commence serious work  usually a paper will be a survey  of the present state of a rather tightly focused topic as a general rule  avoid surveys of broad topics you should plan to treat your topic  thoroughly using the most uptodate sources you can find inevitably  students ask how long a paper must be it is undesirable to make a rule but  ill say that a typical paper tends to be perhaps 20 doublespaced typed or  printed pages        the newsgroup for this course is acc623 on the iu  computer science network use the newsgroup to keep tabs on class business  and to contribute useful information for the other participants in the class    there will be no classroom or final exams on the other hand you will be  expected to function responsibly at the graduate level throughout the course  one paper or talk will be due by march 19 the other paper or talk will be  due by april 25 i may choose to interview students on their papers the  following factors will contribute to your course grade             your attendance record yes we will take attendance you are expected  to be present and to participate in all the class meetings         if you lecture your skill at preparing organizing and presenting your  material where appropriate this will include your timely preparation of  source lists handouts and other documents associated with your  presentation it will also include your skill at selecting and grading  homework problems i will evaluate your lectures assign a grade and upon  request offer comments and criticism         your skill at selecting researching and presenting your written  papers in addition to doing a proper job on the intellectual content of  your paper you will be expected to show proper technical writing skills in  the structure style and grammar in your paper i will assign a grade to  each paper the grade will reflect my judgment of writing skills technical  content and appropriateness of topic         your faithfulness in responding to the homework assignments and the  quality of your responses          in sum the success of a seminar course such as this depends on the active  involvement of the participants and the quality of your participation will  be a criterion in the grading for normal competent work you should expect  a b superior work will earn an a inadequate work will earn a c or below          reference sources for data communications and networks    the swain library has some books and journals of interest for c623 the  library can help you obtain other material through interlibrary loan        our textbook gives useful references at the ends of its chapters          i have an extensive collection of textbooks and reference works check prossers c623  books for the current list and the conditions under which you may borrow  materials          guidelines for lecturers                                    we will be on a strict time schedule for our lectures and we cannot afford  to get off schedule  therefore you must plan your presentations carefully  and must not assume that you can take portions of the lecture time of others        be aware of how your topic fits into the total plan consult with people  whose topics overlap or touch upon yours allocate related or overlapping  subtopics intelligently among your peers most of our lectures will cover  material presented in the textbook if you are lecturing mainly from the  textbook dont plan to cover every subtopic in the book pick several  important subtopics with the instructors help if appropriate and develop  them in reasonable detail if you are using sources other than the textbook  hand out a list of sources at least one week in advance of your lecture so  that others may have a chance to prepare for your lectures put your  important sources on 2hour reserve in the swain library         be prepared to allow up to 2 minutes but no more at the beginning of your  first lecture for old business assign one or two homework exercises related  to your topic select exercises that will help illuminate important aspects  of your topic make the homework problems nontrivial but not too complex or  timeconsuming you will grade the homework for your lecture        use overhead foils or the chalkboard as you prefer the department will  provide 10 overhead transparencies for your lecture if you choose to use  them you will make the transparencies yourself either by drawing directly  on foils or by photocopying prior to your lectures prepare handouts for  distribution if appropriate        when using overheads dont use too many and dont crowd too much  information into each foil the pace of a lecture is considerably faster with  overheads than with the chalkboard and you must allow your audience time to  absorb the material take notes and develop questions         with a wellprepared lecture it is common to have too much material you  must organize and prioritize your material so that you can fit within your  allocated time without rushing if toward the end of the lecture you see that  you wont finish all the good stuff youve prepared dont try to rush on  through new topics you will give a much better lecture if you deal with your  present presumably important topic properly than if you rush to present a  quickie sketch of the remaining material watch the time         on the other hand beware of trying to get by with insufficient preparation  if you find yourself out of material with 30 minutes remaining in the class  you will be embarrassed and the class will be irritated and if you dont know  twice as much as you plan to present and if you havent practiced your  presentation you may find yourself fumbling at the chalkboard and botching  your examples if you need help in judging how much material is appropriate  ill be glad to discuss it with you        you should encourage questions and discussion you are not expected to be an  expert in your topic but you should be sufficiently prepared to lead the  discussion if there are unanswered questions you should investigate them  after your lecture and be prepared to address them next period if your  followup discussion will take no more than 2 minutes it can be made  verbally at the beginning of the next class meeting  if it requires longer  then prepare a brief written response to hand out to the class
