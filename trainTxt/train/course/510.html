spring 9495 offering of the course is   available for purchase or rental  the contents of that course are very similar to   that described here  contact engineering  video outreach at 12088856373 for more information        course description    this course will view software engineering activities from a   management perspective centering around a study of the software development process  we   will view the process in terms of its constituent tasks focusing on the flow of information and   interconnection between tasks  we will highlight interdependencies created by work   products  our approach is in contrast to the traditional software engineering course such as   the prerequisite for this course which focuses on the techniques employed to accomplish   technical activities      topics to be covered include software development paradigms life cycles such as waterfall   evolutionary incremental and spiral software process maturity capability maturity model   and bootstrap model software process assessment and improvement change   management concepts process and product metrics organization and management   strategies and risk assessment  although we will study several management topics this is   not a course in software project management  we will not cover how to manage people and   resources  project management will be discussed only as a constituent tasks in the overall   context of producing a software product  participation in class activities some individual   activities a term project and a final exam will be required  some additional effort will be   required for graduate credit      prerequisites  cs 381581 software engineering or instructors permission  for ntu   students something equivalent to se710 or substantial work experience will be considered   equivalent  knowledge of modern software engineering techniques will be assumed  computer access  none required but access to and use of internet for course material and   electronic mail is expected      goals  the goal of this course is to provide a systematic study of the software  development process with an emphasis on how to define and manage it  this course will expose   participants to several possible approaches to software development identify the tasks that   are essential for successful projects discuss how tasks interact with each other and discuss   how an organization can develop and mature its software development process  the course   will not advocate a particular development approach but rather will take a critical look at the   most popular and most talked about strategies      after successfully completing this course participants will    be familiar with terminology used in this topical area    have read and analyzed important historical and current literature addressing   software life cycle models and software process issues  understand the basic concepts embodied in the most prevalent software life cycle   models including knowledge of their advantages and disadvantages and when it   may be appropriate to use each life cycle approach  be able to construct and represent a software life cycle for an organization or project  be able to construct a project software life cycle that is consistent with a specific   software life cycle model  understand the factors that are important in building the capability or maturity of a   software development organization  be able to assess the maturity level of a software development organization  understand factors that contribute to successful process change implementation  be able to plan and implement a software process improvement activity    texts  mark paulk et al the capability maturity model  guidelines for improving the   software process addison

this subject the   following list presents some resources that you may find useful  for this course you are not   required to have access to these resources and a student without access to them will

students are expected to make a regular contribution to the class  oncampus students should be prepared to offer their comments regarding material presented   ask interesting questions during class and respond with good answers to questions asked in   class  calling to my attention a high quality article not included in the course readings   package on a topic discussed in class is encouraged  off campus students should   communicate with me on a regular basis using telephone fax or email to comment on   material presented in class to provide feedback on industrypractitioner perspectives   regarding topics studied relate personal experiences relevant to class discussions and of   course to ask questions  oncampus students may also make contribution via email  a   significant contribution about every other week is considered the minimum satisfactory  participation level    a portion of some class session will be devoted to discussion and feedback based on   questions and comments supplied from offcampus      assignments  you will be required to perform a software process assessment and to make a   report of your findings  you may evaluate a software development organization with which   you are familiar or you may evaluate a case study i will make available  as a practical   application of some of the course material you will be expected to develop a process   definitionrepresentation of a portion of your work function  this process definition defines the   tasks and interfaces with other people andor organizations        outside readingstudents enrolled for graduate credit cs 585 will be required to read  one book that is related to development life cycles organizational maturity or process   improvement  a list of acceptable books will be provided      term projectthe course also requires an approved term project which should be a  practical application of some concepts studied in the course  the project is expected to be more   extensive for graduate students than for undergraduates  for the project you might prepare a   software management plan following ieee standards develop a software process simulation   model of your organization or study software process metrics from your organization  you   are expected to propose a topic and receive my approval before starting  additional   guidelines will be provided on each of these activities      all assignment projects etc should be sent directly to me not to the video outreach office    the address listed above will work for both us mail federal express and ups  the final   exam must be sent by your examination coordinator to the video outreach office  you will   probably want to keep a copy of all work that you submit just in case something gets lost in the   mail
