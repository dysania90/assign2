william l lewis professor of engineering  dr rer nat munich institute of technology 1966    my interests are in programming methodology in particular the formal development of programs and in related areas such as programming languages programming language semantics and logic i am as interested in the teaching of these topics as i am in further research in them  in fact understanding how logic and formalism can be taught as a useful tool at the freshmansophomore college level has been an overriding concern of mine in the 1990s    click on any of the following items for more information

gries    i was born in flushing new york and spent 21 years there before i escaped  i received a bs queens college in 1960 and went to work for the us naval weapons laboratory as a civilian as a mathematicianprogrammer i met my wifetobe elaine a few months later and we were married in november 1961    we went to illinois for more education i received a masters degree in math from illinois in 1963 my assistantship was to help two germans manfred paul and ruediger wiehle write a full algol compiler for the ibm 7090 computer it was fun figuring out how to implement recursion efficiently before there were many papers on the topic  this ended up in my wife and i going to munich for almost three years i received my doctorate under fl bauer and joseph stoer from mit the munich institute of technology germany in june 1966 this was in math or numerical analysis since computer science theses were not yet kosher    i was an assistant professor of computer science at stanford from 1966 to 1969 while at stanford our twins paul and susan were born what made it more exciting than usual was that they were born on the birthday of myself and my twin 26 april so when my twin is in town elaine makes four birthday cakes  we left stanford because it had no weather we moved to cornell which has weather in 1969 and have been snowed in ever since i was department chair in 198287 and i became the william l lewis professor of engineering in 1992  i had a guggenheim fellowship in 198485       return to table of contents    i am better known for my text writing and my contributions to education than on the wonderfulness of my research  do what you are good at bloom where you are planted i have received a number of awards for contributions to education the 1994 ieee taylor l booth award the acm sigcse award in 1991 a cornell outstanding educator award in 1990 the clark award from cornells college of arts amp sciences in 1986 and the american federation of information processing societies afips education award in 1985    i am proud of all my phd advisees but two stand out susan owickis thesis laid the foundation for proofs of correctness of parallel programs with the notion of interferencefreeness a paper coauthored by us on the topic won the 1977 acm award for best paper in programming langauges and systems and tv ramans thesis just won the acm bestdissertation award for 199394 raman designed and implemented a system for speaking any texlatex document including technical articles and books the same document can be printed or spoken being able to speak mathematics in an effective manner was an important goal of his work reading for the blind is already using his system to produce audio cassettes    i served as chair of the computing research association then the computer science board in the late 1980s when it opened its office in washington and began seriously to represent computing research interests i also conducted the taulbee surveys in the period 19841991 and am proud of obtaining essentially complete responses from phdgranting computer science departments during that period no other comparable survey has had such a response rate  one year it required only 256 telephone calls to get the 150 departments to send in their questionnaires  i received the computing research associations 1991 service award for this work on the surveys and for chairing the association during its move toward respectability and responsibility    i am currently editor for ipl acta informatica formal aspects of computing and software concepts and tools  this editing keeps me busy but i enjoy it i try to take an interest in individual papers when i know the area and will suggest substantial rewrites myself when i believe it will help serve where you can best serve fred b schneider and i are coeditors of springer verlag texts and monographs in computer science    what do i do in my spare time it used to be sports like golf softball volleyball swimming and table tennis once in china i split my pants playing ping pong an hour later while giving a lecture i mentioned that the audience should not laugh when i turned around and i explained why the interpreter spoke and everyone laughed  however i dont know whether he told the truth or just said gries made a joke laugh i also used to sing barbershop and gilbert and sullivan and working around the house carpentry wiring remodeling has taken a lot of time and yielded considerable satisfaction    return to table of contents
