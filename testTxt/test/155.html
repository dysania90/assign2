department chairprofessor   rccscornelledu    phd university of wisconsin madison 1968      research    we are engaged in the study of computer systems that provide  mechanical assistance in problem solving especially in programming  and mathematics  this involves a long term study of ways to make the  formalization of mathematics feasible and useful  we have implemented  three such systems in the past tne years plcv prl and nuprl      our major experimentation is with nuprl a 60000line lisp  program that implements a constructive theory of types  systems such  as nuprl are useful formalizations of mathematics because they can  express a wide variety of proof and programbuilding methods as  metalevel programs of the system  these provide considerable theorem  proving power  moreover nuprl is especially useful because it can  evaluate the computational content of theorems  in principle nuprl  is both a fomal system of mathematics and a programming language      we continue to improve nuprl the current version used at cornell is  called nuprl 4  it differs from its predecessors in having a new term  editor designed by stuart allen and implemented by richard eaton  its  internal structure is more modular making the system suitable for he  definition of a wide variety of logics beyond the builtin  constructive type theory  also the entire theoremproving mechanism  has been rebuilt and streamlined by paul jackson building on the  work of douglas howe  this contributes to the generic nature of nuprl  4  finally this version of the system can refer to itself  there is  an internal description of the language and its logic built  principally by william aitken using the theory developed by allen  howe and myself  richard eaton designed a link between the internal  description of the logic and the logic itself which makes it possible  to prove theorems about the process of proving theorems      we are also engaged in three exciting joint ventures  one is with  miriam leeser of electrical engineering and the other two are in  computer science with david  gries on polya and with  richard  zippel on weyl  with  lesser we are involved in hardware synthesis and verification  leeser and her student mark aagard have used nuprl to prove the  correctness of a 1000line boolean circuit minimization package pbs  used by circuit designers  this is a component of leesers bedroc  system it implements the weak division algorithm which is widely  used in circuit design systems  this major theorem proving effort  taught us a great deal about the effectiveness of our technology in  the hands of expert users from an application domain      the second joint venture involves building a model of the polya programming language and a  program refinement mechanism for it both designed by david gries  which will enable him to write his handbook of algorithms in the  manner that he devised through years of study of the programming  process  stuart allen has givne a formal typetheoretic definition of  polya  we expect to be experimenting soon with transforms and trying  to capture the programming style that gries wants      we have recently begun a collaboration that we hope to relate to the  polya effort  conal mannion has been exploring the possibility of  using nuprl in computational science  we have been discussing  problems with richard zippel and are hoping to connect zippels  symbolic algebra system weyl with nuprl in the near future  this  will be used to explore the development of scientific computing  software using weyl and nuprl together with other tools that zippel is  building      professional activities      editor journal of symbolic computation  editor academic press  editor journal of logic and
