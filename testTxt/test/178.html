teaching assistants            course description     cs 537 is being offered for the first time in fall 1996 it is intended to give students a solid background in the design and development of database management systems dbmss database systems are possibly the worlds largest pieces of software and certainly among the most valuable pieces of software while a dbms is in one sense a giant application program there are surprisingly many principles behind its development and use the database industry is growing and thriving and the demand for knowledgeable database engineers is much greater than the supply the database research community is also active and there are always new problems to be addressed because of the explosive amounts of data that people wish to access this course forms essential background for anyone who wants to a become a systems engineer at a database development company or b become an informed user of database systems or c become a database systems researcher or d develop systems in any domain that manipulate large amounts of data or e find out how a teller machine really works     a number of advanced fundamental dbms concepts will be covered although this is not intended to be an introductory course it is a new course and there may be students in the class with different backgrounds consequently the discussion of various topics will begin with a quick review of basic material taught in cs 432 click here for a tentative list of topics to be covered     in terms of workload heres what the course involves    there will be a midterm and a final examination these will test a breadth of basic concepts   each student will have to do a survey paper on a specific advanced topic here is a list of possible topics the purpose of this is to be aware that what is being taught in the course is only a fraction of what is out there this paper will be due three weeks after the midterm and should be complete with references it will require reading papers from journals and conference proceedings in the engineering library i will suggest initial references and you will have to pursue additional references from there click here for information on reference material in the library   a development project involving c programming look here for more information   there will be no written homework assignments   students take turns writing lecture notes depending on enrollment this means each person will have to take notes once or twice in the semester hopefully this additional work will turn out to be useful around exam time here are the details in ps            development project     the term project is an important part of the course and will involve a significant amount of c programming you can choose whether you wish to work alone or in teams of two however the twoperson projects will involve proportionally more work the goal of the project is twofold a to get handson experience at building some specific dbms component b to get comfortable working with a large preexisting codebase and modifying it in a modular manner the second goal is as important as the first one because all database systems are huge software systems and rarely do you have the luxury of starting from scratch this forces you to write modular code and also to understand the interaction between the different system components when the inevitable bugs appear     there are two research dbms prototypes that will be used in the projects one is minibase which is software associated with the textbook it is a simple singleuser database system that provides all the components from the sql parser down to the disk manager this should hopefully be available depending on our being able to compile and run it in our computing environment the important part of minibase is the interface description of the various system components the actual code comes from class projects consequently projects using minibase will involve writing a component like the buffer manager based on a specification of its c interface     the other prototype is predator which is a query processing engine that i have been developing for my research there are a number of possible projects some of which could lead to research topics that can be built on top of predator the focus here is on the highend functionality like complex queries and new data types     if you are not familiar with c i recommend a minibase project because the amount of design needed is minimal if you think you are interested in database systems research then you should do a predator project if you fall in neither category then you should decide whether you want a project at the lowerlevel dbms storage access buffer areas or the higherlevel query processing optimization areas and choose between minibase lowerlevel and predator higherlevel there are also some general projects that involve neither system if you have your own idea on a suitable project you should talk with me about it well in advance of the project proposal date     here is a tentative list of possible projects in all the projects there will be certain steps that should be followed    as part of the project proposal you should discuss with me and submit an ordered list of pieces of functionality that the project will produce   there will be a midproject review in which you meet with me to discuss the progress that you have made towards completing the project   the code you write must follow the coding conventions of the particular system that you are working on a detailed coding conventions document will be provided and should be followed closely this is something that i will be very picky on and that will contribute to the grade you get on the project   project submission should include a demo and a reasonable amount of test data      some useful references are    home page for predator   home page for minibase            course textbook     the primary text is a beta edition of a new book on database systems  database management systems by raghu ramakrishnan this book contains many more details than are in most other introductory database books it is also associated with free software for an instructional database system minibase which we might use in class assignments the textbook is available in the campus store for 46 here are other textbooks which could be used as references    korth amp silberschatz database system concepts mcgrawhill second edition 1991   this is the standard introductory database text but lacks the detail to be used in a graduate course   michael stonebraker readings in database systems morgan kaufmann second edition 1994  this is a collection of relatively recent papers in the area collected and introduced by stonebraker who developed the ingres postgres and illustra database systems many of these are fundamental papers on core areas   elmasri amp navathe fundamentals of database systems benjamincummings second edition 1994   this is an alternative introductory database text   gray amp reuter transaction processing concepts and techniques morgan kaufmann 1993   this is the bible of transaction processing 1000 pages long and tells you all there is to know and a lot more about transactions it is a wonderful reference to clear up confusing aspects of concurrency control recovery transaction semantics etc      some reference material has also been placed in the library click here for details       c information     here are some resources about c programming    c tutorial   cs

exam  25   final exam  25   survey paper  lecture notes  15   term project  35      the prelim exam will be on the evening of oct 10th at 730pm in upson 111111a it will be set to be comfortably finished in 15 hrs but an extra half hour will be provided for those who need it likewise for the final exam the final should be in exam period 16 thurs dec 19 9001130am but this again is tentative and needs to be confirmed the final exam will focus on material not tested in the midterm but the material covered in the earlier part of the course may form background for some of the questions
