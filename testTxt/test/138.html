class data type in our  computing environment to this end my research group   project zeno  is building technologies supporting the storage communication and  processing of continuous media data  in contrast to other commercial  and research approaches which require specialized hardware operating  systems or networks to be usable all of these technologies we are  designing fit into the current research environment  our premise is  that the current hardware software and communication infrastructure  is sufficient to support research into continuous media systems and  applications  we are verifying this hypothesis by building working  systems        our research on storage systems is directed towards building the zeno  distributed video file server  the zeno architecture uses a network of  workstations connected by a generic local area network eg an  ethernet a common environment in computing research laboratories  each workstation can act simultaneously as both a client and a server  of continuous media data   as a client a workstation plays video  stored on one or more servers as a server a workstation is a file  server for video data  each client can receive video stored at several  servers and each server can service several clients   compared with  large centralized servers the advantages of this design are       scalability  as new clients are added new servers are       automatically added     load balancing the load generated by serving videos is distributed       both across machines and across networks in the case where the       servers are located on different networks     low initial investment by utilizing existing infrastructure the       zeno architecture promotes early adoption in research environments       with almost no initial investment          our research on communication systems is centered around best effort  delivery protocols  such protocols are built on existing network  protocols and in contrast to many other research efforts do not need  to reserve network resources to establish a connection  resource  reservation protocols are well suited to the national communication  infrastructure where users can be charged on a per call basis for  bandwidth and connections but are poorly suited to network  environments where the network is a shared resource equally accessible  by all researchers  our approach is appropriate for the latter  environments commonly found in research laboratories  the  communication protocol we have developed called cyclicudp is built  on top of the udp datagram protocol and is designed to transport audio  and video data in playback applications in local metropolitan and  wide area networks  cyclicudp is used by the zeno file server to  deliver audio and video data to clients  a   paper describing cyclic udp is available  online  as well as the   slides from a research talk         our research on processing video data has been twofold  first we are  developing algorithms to process video data in the compressed  representation  processing video without decompression leads to  dramatic speedups in processing performance since it both removes the  timeconsuming processes of compression and decompression and reduces  the amount of data that must be processed  experiments with an  implementation of these ideas on jpeg compressed image data indicates  that the data can be processed one to two orders of magnitude faster  than what was possible with previous approaches  we are currently  extending these ideas by parallelizing the algorithms using networks of  workstations and by developing a method for transcoding video in  software  in video transcoding video is translated from one  compression format to another a useful operation for video file  servers that must service heterogeneous clients  a  paper describing compressed  domain processing  is available online        our research on video processing is also exploring methods to simplify  experimentation with video processing by developing a programming  language where video is a first class data type  this language called  rivl pronounced rival allows  video processing effects to be specified independent of the resolution  and format of the source material  the language does for video what  postscript did for text and graphics it provides a resolution  independent method for specifying video processing  thus the same  program can process low quality quicktime video very quickly while  editing decisions are made and then be used to format a high quality  finished product offline in much the same way that postscript can be  previewed on a workstation at low quality then sent to a 2600 dpi  printer for camera ready copy   a  paper describing rvl   is available online        a  talk that reviews our research on  video processing  both compressed domain processing and rivl  is available online        the common theme of all these efforts is to provide tools to make video  usable in our research environment  a  talk that reviews this research   is also available online      teaching        at cornell university i teach an undergraduate course  cs 314 on computer
