kleinberg        kleinbercscornelledu   assistant professor of computer science   cornell university   ithaca ny  148537501        my research interests are in algorithms and combinatorial optimization  with an emphasis on approximation computational geometry   network optimization and distributed computing and   algorithms in molecular biology  recent work has included       approximation algorithms for routing and  disjoint paths problems in networks   adversarial queueing theory an approach to analyzing the stability  of network routing protocols without probabilistic assumptions   geometric methods in combinatorial optimization particularly  the use of positive semidefinite programming and   geometric algorithms for studying molecular conformation      i am
