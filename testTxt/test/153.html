professor  phd state univ of ny stony brook 1978          techniques for understanding concurrent programs are becoming increasingly  important as distributed computing systems become widespread in  missioncritical applications  my research has focused on the development  of these techniques    i have been heavily involved in applying assertional reasoning to the  design of concurrent distributed faulttolerant and realtime programs   i am completing a textbook on this subject  along with david gries i  continue investigations concerning our firstorder equational logic e   this past year we streamlined the inference rules and evaluated a number  of techniques for handling undefined terms and partial functions    thomas bressoud and i completed building and analyzing our hypervisorbased  implementation of replication management for hps parisc architecture   our protocols ensure that the sequence of instructions executed by two  virtual machines running on different physical processors are identical   the protocols also coordinate io issued by these virtual machines  use of  a hypervisor to implement replica coordination is attractive  at least in  theory  when replica coordination is implemented in a hypervisor it  instantly becomes available to all hardware realizations of the given  instructionset architecture including realizations that did not exist  when the hypervisor was written  second when replica coordination is  implemented in a hypervisor a single implementation suffices for every  operating system that executes on that instructionset architecture   finally by implementing replica coordination in a hypervisor the  applications programmer is freed from this task    jointly with dag johansen university of troms  norway and robbert van  renesse i started the tacoma project troms  and cornell moving agents to  investigate support and use of mobile processes in building  missioncritical applications  by structuring a system in terms of agents  applications can be constructed in which communicationnetwork bandwidth is  conserved  data may be accessed only by an agent executing at the same  site as the data resides  an agent typically will filter or otherwise  reduce the data it reads carrying with it only the relevant information as  it roams the network  two tacoma prototypes have been completed and we  are implementing a third system based on our experiences    finally i developed with scott stoller a new algorithm for detecting  whether a particular computation of an asynchronous distributed system  could have passed through a global state satisfying some given state  predicate  the new algorithm allows more efficient detection than is  possible with previous algorithms      university activities  sabbatical leave 199495
