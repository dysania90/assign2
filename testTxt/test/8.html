212 fall 1996      course information    august 29 1996      cs212 is an introductory course covering a broad range of computer science concepts and techniques including data abstraction recursion program correctness generic functions object oriented programming pattern matching and languages and their evaluators  we use the dylan language an object oriented dynamic language developed at apple computer which is well suited for covering a broad range of introductory computer science topics  this is not a course about the dylan language it just happens to be the notation that we have chosen for writing programs  the major goals of the course are to teach students how to think clearly about programs and programming and to provide a toolbox of modern programming techniques that will be applicable in any language       what course to take students often wonder whether to take cs211 or cs212  cs211 focuses on programming skills in the objectoriented language java whereas cs212 provides exposure to a broad range of computational and programming problems using a number of programming paradigms including functional objectoriented and imperative programming techniques  if you have a good cs background or good formal skills eg mathematics or physics you should probably take cs212 transfers between cs211 and cs212 in either direction are encouraged during the first two weeks      reaching us       the best way to reach the course staff is by posting questions or comments using the cs212 web site   this site contains all course materials and runs a conote server which allows students and staff to post questions and answers as annotations to the handouts and problem sets  in order to access the web site you will need to request a userid and password for the conote system  to do this simply go to the cs212 home page and follow the instructions  your userid and password will be created by monday if you request them this week      you can also reach the course staff is by sending email to cs212cscornelledu but this should not be used for asking questions about problem sets or handouts use the web site         who we are         dan huttenlocher professor 4119 upson     tobias mayr ta 5148 upson    james hamblin ugrad ta    robert szewczyk ugrad ta    justin voskuhl ugrad ta    andras ferencz consultant     melissa ho consultant      when we meet      lectures are tuesday and thursday at 1010 in b11 kimball and recitations are monday and wednesday at 125 230 or 335  recitations expand on the material in lecture and provide more opportunity to ask questions         consulting hours for help with problem sets or other questions will be held from 7pm until midnight the two evenings before each problem set is due see schedule below  thus for problem sets due on a tuesday there will be consulting hours sunday and monday evenings and for those due on a thursday there will be consulting hours tuesday and wednesday evenings consulting hours are in the public mac lab in b7 upson      office hours are james hamblin tba dan huttenlocher t 100200 tobias mayr f 1215115 robert szewczyk tba justin voskuhl tba      course materials      there is no textbook for this course  there will be course handouts and lecture notes which will be available both in hardcopy and on the course web site      the dylan interpreter is available free on the course web site and was developed by justin voskuhl for this class  it is implemented in java and thus will run under any java capable web browser  the best current browser it changes almost weekly is netscape 30 for windows95nt which has borlands justintime java compiler  there are also standalone versions available that you can download onto your computer if you do not want to use the web browser version  one word of warning if you download a standalone dylan onto your machine make sure that you are using the most recent version by checking the web site      course requirements      students are responsible for all material in the assigned readings as well as that covered in lectures and in recitations  there will be six problem sets two preliminary exams and a final exam a schedule is given below  each problem set will be a combination of written exercises and a programming assignment  course grades will be based on a combination of the problem sets and exam scores  the problem sets will account for approximately one half of the total grade no late assignments will be accepted we will generally grade assignments immediately and return them the following class period      you should try to complete the programming assignments early as we will not accept late work the best use of your time and the machines time is to think about the problems before sitting down at the computer no matter how many times we say this it takes a long time to sink in think about the problems before sitting down at the computer      policy on joint work      much of the learning in this course comes from doing the programming problems  you may work jointly with one other person on the assignments no more than two people should work together  however if you work together with someone you must submit a single joint assignment with both names on it  under no circumstances may you hand in work done with or by someone else under your own name  if in doubt credit the persons from whom you got help  you would be amazed at how easy it is to tell when people work together on problem sets so please dont make life unpleasant for all of us by breaking these rules      public lab facilities      cit and various colleges on campus provide public macintosh and pc facilities you may use your own machine or the public ones  the cs department does not provide computer facilities for this course the course consultants will be available in the b7 upson mac lab see above      problem set due dates and exam dates      all problem sets are due before 2am on the due date  for example an assignment due tuesday must be submitted electronically to the course server by 2am on tuesday that is late monday night  no late assignments are accepted so make sure you submit your final solution by the correct time and date      912 assignment 1     924 assignment 2     108 assignment 3     1017 prelim 1 730pm     1029 assignment 4     1112 assignment 5     1119 prelim 2 730pm
