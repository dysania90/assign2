programming assignments   instructorstas   academic integrity  please read it and      remember it well     cs100b course description       computer science 100b  introduction to computer programming      offered in fall  4 credits  prerequisites knowledge of continuous mathematics trigonometry and calculus   math 111 or 191 or equivalent      an introduction to elementary computer programming concepts emphasis is on  techniques of problem analysis and the development of algorithms and programs the subject of the course is programming not a particular programming  language the principal programming language is c the course does not presume previous programming experience programming assignments are tested and run on interactive standalone microcomputers      alternative version of com s 100 emphasizing examples and applications  involving continuous mathematics including trigonometry and calculus      cs100b vs cs100a      computer science 100b basically teaches the same material as cs100a there are a some differences though besides the last letter cs100b assumes the knowledge andor familiarity with continuous math as opposed to discrete one including trigonometry and calculus one might wonder what that means in a  programming course well computer science and math interact in many ways and  cs100b  introduces one of them  scientific computing this does not mean that  cs100a is easier than cs100b it means that if you think you are comfortable with integrals derivatives etc cs100b will show you ways of applying your  knowledge to computer programming the point of it is not necessarily to  test that knowledge but rather expand it and apply it i would  like to encourage people who think they would  qualify to take this course continuous math might not sound that attractive  but  you can only benefit with this choice it is often hard to find good  examples of real world problems in an intro course for cs but cs100b finds one if you are not sure whether you qualify please talk to the instructor  prof zabih and ask him for an opinion     besides that there is a slight difference in the topics taught in 100b and  100a although for the most part they coincide one with another if you  already know a bit about c cs100b will spend some more time on pointers and the model of the language itself if you dont know what this means it doesnt  matter  just disregard the last sentence       grading  policies      grades for cs100b will be computed as follows        cs100b course grades programs20 prelim 110 prelim 220 prelim 320 final  30          graded assignments and exams will be returned in sections you can pick up the unclaimed assignmentsexams from a consultant in carpenter  provided you have an id with you      regrades if you feel an exam or a program has been incorrectly graded fill out a regrade request giving your reasons in writing attach the exam to  it and give it to the consultant in the carpenter lab a regrade request can cause your grade to go up or down  the paper will be regraded from  scratch    a regrade must be submited within one week after the graded work has  been returned      posted grades grades will be posted outside the carpenter lab by either srudent id or a fourdigit code that you give us it is your  responibility to verify that our records are correct if you find an error please contact the course administrator laurie buck but please only during  her office hours   note since an error in our records can occur you should probably keep your graded assignmentsexams until you doublechecked  your grade with the posted one      exam schedule         exam times examdatetimelocation prelim 1mon september 30730 pmtba prelim 2tue october 22730 pmtba prelim 3tue november 19730 pm al kimball b11 mz

programming problems and work additional problems and excercises graded programs and exams are returned in sections sample  solutions and practice exams are handed out there     all sections for cs 100b each week will cover the same topics therefore if you miss one you can substitute it with another one later that week however you will be registered for only one section and that will be the only one where you can pick up your graded work also excersises might differ in different  sections depending on the instructor and the interests of the students      handoutsannouncements       obtaining the copies  if you miss a class or for some other reason not get a handout there are always copies of them in the carpenter lab if they run out please tell it to one of the consultants there and we will print more of them out       course notes     2nd lecture    sorry about the special  characters in the handout that look funky on the web im working on improving it  4th lecture   6th lecture

syllabus course material completely  lost just come to us and well try to put you back on track you can also  ask consultants in carpenter to tutor you during more quiet hours if you have any complaints about the course assignments are too hard or you just cannot grasp of what in the world the instructor is talking about etc please tell us this will not affect your grade in any negative manner      academic integrity      you may work with one other person on the programming assignments below a group refers to either an individual or a pair two of students working together on a program     the work you submit is cs 100 must be the result of your groups effort only the use of a computer in no way modifies the standard academic integrity expected under the cornell university code of conduct you may discuss work with students not in your group eg you may discuss general strategies  however cooperation should never involve one student possessing  a copy of all or a part of a program written by a student outside the group regardless of whether that copy is on paper or on a disk in addition any output submitted with your program must have been produced by your program by running it as described in the assignment     the penalty for violating the code can include failure in cs 100  university disciplinary action and a permanent mark on your transcript     ask first if you have any questions about whether a particular behavior  violates our integrity expectations or the university code           this page is page is mantained by weiwei if you have any comments  suggestions error reports complaints etc about this site please mail me at weiweicscornelledu and i  will try to satisfy your needs as long as it doesnt violate the university policies       last
