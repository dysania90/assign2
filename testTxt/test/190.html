associate professor  phd mit 1986           my research group works in the areas of programming languages and compilers  for parallel architectures    our goal is to develop tools for generating parallel code for applications  programs that deal with large sparse matrices  most scientific  applications involve the numerical solution of partial differential  equations  the techniques used almost always produce a system of algebraic  equations that involve large sparse matrices  unfortunately existing  compiler technology does a poor job of parallelizing sparse matrix  programs  we take a radically different approach to this problem  our  compiler produces parallel sparsematrix programs from sequential  densematrix programs using information from the user about the sparsity  structure of matrices in the program  this enables us to use tools from  the restructuring compiler area  preliminary experiments with some krylov  space solvers show that the code produced by our compiler is competitive  with handparallelized code in libraries like argonnes petsc library  we  will extend our approach to direct methods for solving linear systems and  to applications that require adaptive mesh refinement    this project builds on our earlier work on restructuring compilation  techniques for dense matrix programs  we have developed restructuring  techniques for compiling programs to distributed memory and nonuniform  memory access numa architectures like the ibm sp2 and cm5 where a  processor can access local memory faster than nonlocal memory  to get  good performance the compiler must not only parallelize but must also  ensure locality of reference by matching code and data distribution when  nonlocal references must be made block transfers are preferable to many  small messages  we recently developed the best algorithm known for the  automatic alignment of computation and data and are incorporating it into  our compiler testbed  in earlier work we developed a novel loop  restructuring technique called access normalization which transforms loop  nests for increased locality and potential for block transfers and  implemented it in the lambda loop transformation toolkit  our paper  summarizing these results won the best paper prize at asplos v  we worked  with hewlettpackard to transfer this technology to hps fortran compiler  product line for uniprocessors and multiprocessors    we have developed new frameworks for program analysis and optimization  based on the dependence flow graph dfg  the dfg knits together the data  and control dependence information of a program permitting the development  of optimization algorithms that generate better code than is possible with  competing approaches  our results are of independent interest for  example we recently developed optimal algorithms for control dependence  problems answering a foundational question that had been open for almost  a decade  this work led to the development of a lineartime algorithm for  computing the static single assignment ssa form of programs  these  results have been incorporated into a number of compilers including those  at ibm
