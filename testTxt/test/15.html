subfields within artificial intelligence including machine learning casebased reasoning and cognitive modeling the focus of my research is in the area of natural language understanding nlpnlu    the nlp group at cornell is primarily interested in investigating the use of machine learning techniques as tools for guiding natural language system development and for exploring the mechanisms that underly language acquisition  our work focuses on two related areas 1 the design of usertrained systems that can efficiently and reliably extract the important information from a document and 2 the machine learning of natural language     information extraction  as part of cornells cstr project we are using information extraction techniques to support contentbased browsing of technical texts     the kenmore project   the focus of the kenmore project is on developing techniques to automate the knowledge acquisition tasks that comprise the building of any nlp system very generally kenmore acquires linguistic knowledge using a combination of symbolic machine learning techniques and robust sentence analysis  it has been used with corpora from two realworld domains to perform partofspeech tagging semantic feature tagging and concept activation and to find the antecedents of relative pronouns  in current work we are extending kenmore to handle larger text corpora and additional disambiguation tasks  in all of our work we evaluate the language learning components in the context of the larger nlp application in which it is embedded the goal of the project is to determine the conditions under which machine  learning techniques can be expected to offer a costeffective approach to knowledge acquisition for nlp systems     teaching   cs674 natural language understanding
