either  the macintosh or the pc version though you do not have to    computer labs  this course has been designated to use the three computer labs   b7 upson b8 sibley and g83 martha van rensselaer    problem sets    there will be 6 assignments which will be handed out in lecture or  from this page  extras will be available in rack outside upson  303 assignments will be collected in class  all the computing  problems will be done in matlab return of graded work will be  handled in class    an assignment is due at the beginning of the class on the due  date  late assignments wont be accepted for credit the worst grade  from the six assignments will be ignored for the final grade    each assignment can be done alone or with at most one partner  print  your name one copy with both names if working in pairs on the first  page and include your student id no change or addition of partner  names after an assignment has been handed in    exams  there will be a midterm and a final exam days and times are listed below    grading  your final total score will be computed as follows    best 5 assignments 40 midterm 30 final 30 your final grade will be  assigned according to your relative

you plan to work on your own stand alone computer or at a lab other  than the assigned ones here is the source code for the examples              for mac 125kb scmvsithqx file          for other systems msdos or unix 43kb scmvtargz         you uncompress and untar with the unix command          zcat scmvtargz  tar xfv           it is highly recommended you get and use zcat   or just browse through an               ftp session        you need a postscript file viewer installed at your computer in order   to see the files below       handouts                     gtgt
