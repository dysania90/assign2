supercomputing 96 pittsburgh pa november 1996         abstract     the ibm sp is one of the most powerful commercial mpps yet in spite  of its fast processors and high network bandwidth the sps  communication latency is inferior to older machines such as the tmc  cm5 or meiko cs2 this paper investigates the use of active messages  am communication primitives as an alternative to the standard  message passing in order to reduce communication overheads and to  offer a good building block for higher layers of software    the first part of this paper describes an implementation of active  messages sp am which is layered directly on top of the sps network  adapter tb2  with comparable bandwidth sp ams low overhead yields  a roundtrip latency that is 40 lower than ibm mpls  the second  part of the paper demonstrates the power of am as a communication  substrate by layering splitc as well as mpi over it splitc  benchmarks are used to compare the sp to other mpps and show that low  message overhead and high throughput compensate for sps high network  latency  the mpi implementation is based on the freely available  mpich version and achieves performance equivalent to ibms mpif

abstract     this technical report describes the design implementation and  evaluation of active messages on the ibm sp2  the implementation  benchmarked here uses the standard tb2 network adapter firmware but  does not use any ibm software on the power2 processor  we assume  familiarity with the concepts underlying active messages  the main  performance characteristics are a oneword message roundtrip time  of 510 us and an asymptotic network bandwidth of 343 mbs  after presenting selected implementation details the paper focuses  on detailed performance analysis including a comparison

lowlatency communication over atm networks  using active messages   thorsten von eicken veena avula anyndia basu vineet buch  presented at hot interconnects ii  aug 1994 palo alto ca  an abridged version of this paper appears in ieee micro magazine feb 1995       slides from hot interconnect talk     abstract     recent developments in communication architectures for  parallel machines have made significant progress and reduced the  communication overheads and latencies by over an order of magnitude as  compared to earlier proposals this paper examines whether these  techniques can carry over to clusters of workstations connected by an  atm network even though clusters use standard operating system  software are equipped with network interfaces optimized for stream  communication do not allow direct protected userlevel access to the  network and use networks without reliable transmission or flow  control     in a first part this paper describes the differences in  communication characteristics between clusters of workstations built  from standard hardware and software components and stateoftheart  multiprocessors the lack of flow control and of operating system  coordination affects the communication layer design significantly and  requires larger buffers at each end than on multiprocessors a second  part evaluates a prototype implementation of the lowlatency active  messages communication model on a sun workstation cluster  interconnected by an atm network measurements show  applicationtoapplication latencies of about 20 microseconds for small  messages which is roughly comparable to the active messages  implementation on the thinking machines cm5 multiprocessor        active messages a mechanism for integrated communication and  computation  von eicken t d e culler s c goldstein and k e schauser  proceedings of the 19th intl symp on computer architecture  may 1992 gold coast australia       abstract     the design challenge for largescale multiprocessors is 1 to  minimize communication overhead 2 allow communication to overlap  computation and 3 coordinate the two without sacrificing  processor costperformance  we show that existing message passing  multiprocessors have unnecessarily high communication costs  research  prototypes of message driven machines demonstrate low communication  overhead but poor processor costperformance  we introduce a simple  communication mechanism active messages show that it is  intrinsic to both architectures allows cost effective use of the  hardware and offers tremendous flexibility  implementations on ncube2  and cm5 are described and evaluated using a splitphase sharedmemory  extension to c splitc  we further show that active messages  are sufficient to implement the dynamically scheduled languages for  which message driven machines were designed  with this mechanism  latency tolerance becomes a programmingcompiling concern  hardware  support for active messages is desirable and we outline a range of  enhancements to mainstream processors        active messages an efficient  communication architecture for multiprocessors von eicken t  phd thesis november 1993 university of california at berkeley
