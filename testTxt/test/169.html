this page is evolving  it is incomplete but hopefully useful   this is the beginnings of a home page for cs 417 which deals with computer graphics and scientific visualization at the level of   computer graphics principles and practice  by foley etal  or  3d computer graphics  by alan watt  cs 417 is currently taught by bruce land who is also the project leader for the visualization group at
