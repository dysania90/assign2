founded the  cornell robotics and vision laboratory  in 1991     research my interests include  robotics   microelectromechanical systems  geometric algorithms and artificial intelligence   robotics is the science that seeks  to forge an intelligent computational connection between perception  and action  working with graduate student jim jennings research associate  daniela rus graduate student  russell brown and lab alumnus  jonathan rees now at mit we developed a  team of autonomous mobile robots that can perform sophisticated  distributed manipulation tasks such as  moving furniture  the robots run robust spmd protocols that are completely asynchronous and require no communication with grad student  karl b hringer and ee professor noel macdonald we are building a  massively parallel array of microactuators in the cornell national nanofabrication laboratory  the array is a scream chip containing over 11000 actuators in 1 square centemeter and can orient small parts without sensory feedback our microfabricated actuator arrays could be used to construct programmable partsfeeders at any scale or to build selfpropelled ics walking vlsi chips  graduate student  amy briggs worked with dan huttenlochers vision group to develop  a sensor planning and surveillance system for a team of mobile robots the robots use onboard vision to detect and intercept targets in the lab   demos
