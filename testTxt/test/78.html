documents   title in audio         aster demonstration      is dedicated to my   guidedog    aster audio system for technical readings is a computing system for  rendering technical documents in audio  aster was developed by  me for my    phd 141 pages  an audio formatted version of the thesis   approximately 6 hours produced by aster is being made available by   rfb recordings for the blind   as the first computer generated talking book   here is the  abstract  in print and   here is an audio formatted version          this hypertext document demonstrates the audio renderings generated by aster   here   is an enhanced demo using inline images  each example is made up of three components        the original latex input       the audio formatted output produced by aster         the speech is produced by a dectalk and has been digitized at         8bit mulaw         aster uses stereo to render tables an effect that is not         conveyed by the  8bit mono encoding        the visually formatted version produced by latex and dvips        how to use this demo     the examples in this demonstration get progressively difficult   i suggest you go through the initial sections sequentially  for short demos i typically show people the first three sections and  round it off   with the continuous fraction in section 4 and a quick overview of faa  de brunos formula                here  is the postscript file containing all the examples in case  you want to look over them first   i am not placing a  single file containing all of the audio examples  since this would be about 9mb         section 1  simple fractions and expressions    this set of examples demonstrates the use of voice inflection and pauses to  convey grouping of subexpressions succinctly               audio

audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript       audio state varied along a dimension in audio space before rendering  subexpressions        section 2  superscripts and subscripts    to convey subscripts superscripts and other visual attributes vary audio  state along a dimension that is orthogonal  to independent of  the dimension  used to convey subexpressions  this will allow the nesting of these mutually independent concepts          audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript

they are used in the tex book to demonstrate the power of the tex layout  operators  notice that all of these examples comprise of the same 6 symbols but are very  different  aster can render these as unambiguously as tex can           audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript

notion of perceptible monotonicity is vital in conveying nesting           audio    latex    postscript         section 5  simple school algebra             audio    latex    postscript      audio

postscript      audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript           section 7  trigonometric identities    written mathematical notation can be ambiguous and hard to recognize  notice the complete absence of parenthesis in some of the examples below  aster uses several heuristics to construct the correct tree structure for  these expressions           audio    latex

opposed to  log of x to the base a            audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript           section 9

  the first of these examples probably the most innocuous is also the most  difficult to recognize it is impossible to determine the variable of  integration        notice that aster interprets triple integrals as the nested application of the  integral operator  a user can browse the triple integral and listen to its subpieces          the integrals  shown in examples 3 and 4 can trick the most experienced of  human readers into an error          audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript      audio

referenced equations    the following section is meant to illustrate asters rendering of  crossreferences and is most effective when aster is used interactively        aster enables the listener to give meaningful names to crossreferenceable  objects and uses these names when referring to such objects in later  crossreferences               audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex

  audio    latex    postscript         section 15  quantified expression    the quantifiers present an interesting challenge to asters recognizer         audio    latex    postscript           section 16  exponentiation    once again perceptible monotonicity allows aster to convey the following  deeply nested expressions succinctly      these examples were produced with the emacs calculator a fullfledged  symbolic algebra system  aster  interfaces directly with this calculator and renders the output just  as well as it can render any document            audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript      audio    latex    postscript           section 17  a generic matrix    aster uses stereo effects to convey the twodimensional structure of the  matrix  rendering commences on the left and moves progressively right as  each element of any row is spoken         audio    latex    postscript         section 18  faa de brunos formula    this section presents faa de brunos formula taken from knuths art of  computer programming vol 1  i first heard it spoken by a rfb reader on a talking book it took 120 seconds  to speak        since the renderings produced by aster utilize features of the audio space  not available to a human reader i still have not met a reader who can change  the size and shape of her  head as she talks  the rendering takes under 80 seconds        as you will hear soon even this is too long you forget the beginning by the  time you hear the end        later we present rendering using variable substitution a powerful technique  for conveying toplevel structure of complex expressions          notice the proper intonational structure produced for text intermixed       with mathematics           audio         latex       postscript    audio    latex        postscript   here is faa de brunos formula in all its glory          audio 66 seconds        latex    postscript        aster can process complex expressions like the above and upon request  replace complex subexpressions with meaningful identifiers such renderings  convey toplevel structure the listener can then listen to the  subexpressions separately        since this substitution process is performed by aster there is no latex or  postscript equivalent for the audio output in this case      the toplevel formula   audio 20 seconds    lower constraint 1
