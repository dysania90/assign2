the forest    whats around the clearing   looking around you you realize you must have walked much further than youd planned to  theres a wide variety of trees surrounding you on all sides but especially oak trees  the weather seems fairly overcast but you somehow cant figure out if its going to rain or snow  perhaps it will do both    off in the distance you can see a large mountain where its quite clear that it is snowing  no question about it      you hear birds chirping quite near to where you areof course they may be responding to the sounds inside the clearing     but the much much louder sounds are coming from a nearby waterfallyou cant see it but its gotta be big  you could follow the sound if you wantedthere seems to be a path leaving that direction    there are two other paths leaving the clearing  one is labeled with a sign that says the hill school  the other is labeled with the sign the hell school     theres also a small wormhole which seems to connect to a nearby house presumably theres a lot of traffic between the two places      whats inside the clearing   inside the clearing are a couple of structures  theres a 10 x 12 shack with a door thats falling off and a completely modern glass house with no stones in front of it    theres a pile of books scores magazines and random papers scattered all throughout the clearing as well  it seems like theres some vague rhyme and reason to it but glancing at the topics there seem to be a few on all sorts of topics  you figure that if youd look at the most recently read books youd probably have a better idea of what makes the person in the clearing tick    theres also a resume that you see  it seems somewhat off in the cornerpresumably he has more important things to worry about    he seems kind of strange    the guy in the clearing   he smiles over at you and says hello  hes about 58 and is often described as being way too thin especially by his mother  his most distinctive feature is his hair which is bright golden red and quite long  he looks vaguely elfin but youve seen more elflike people before      warning links in next paragraphs not yet written  ill get there soon     more obvious is that hes always doing 15 things at oncehe starts telling you a story but then stops and hums a tune  then he starts telling you why nicholas negroponte is a moron but if youve never heard of him he starts talking to you about gay politics in late twentiethcentury america  then he pauses and starts talking about some obscure theorem from theoretical computer science    its obvious that hes rather well read from listening to him but he tends to go on a bit much so you start looking at his appearance instead    hes wearing mostly two colors purple and a dark turquoise everything hes wearing seems to be either silk or linen and contrasts nicely with his hair  he has on glasses as well    theres a gold ring with an image of a beaver on his right ring finger the beaver is pointing away from him  on his left ring finger is a silver ring with an ocean wave pattern on it  hes also wearing a pewter pentacle around his neck and looks altogether more like a neohippie than someone whos as classically intellectualsounding as he sounds like he is    other people who visit the clearing  dan starts talking about the people who occasionally visit and whom he has spent time with    brian is an old friend from mit whom i used to live with when i was an undergrad  nowadays he works for pointcast which is an internet news provider      anca mosoiu pronounced m schwa sh oi u is my best friend from back when we were at mit  i used to eat with her many times a week for two and a half years and we went to europe together the summer after we graduated in 1995  oh and im her inner child by the way  she just quit working at one wave dont blame her for that dreadful name  actually it used to be businessweb and before that it was object power  feh     daniel is someone ive gotten to know quite a bit better over the last several months i think we met probably sometime last november but we became much better friends over the summer  hes switched out of the ee department quite wisely and is having much more fun as a multimedia student in the dept of communications  for some reason thats in the ag school  he also has a small internet business he coowns with a friend of his    there used to be a link to perry finleys page here  but theres not anymore  instead brian has some pictures of perry on his pictures page      my dad works for  steelcase which is the largest manufacturer of office furniture in the world  the rampd server that they have on the web is kinda cheesy it used to just have the picture of the pyramid but it is still a neat pic of the building dad works in     tim is a guy i used to sing with here at cornell  he just left for japan for a program called jet which hired him to teach english to high school students there in an ideal world ill visit him next winter or so    hani graduated from mit this june and it couldnt have happened to someone who more needed to get out of that place  ack  but hes a great guy even so    nick is a good guy who i met about a year and a half ago  hes a lot cuter than the somewhat blurry picture on his web page would indicate     we are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreamsaphex twin
